  "title": "Maid, Mage, Tower",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/maid-mage-tower",
  "content": "Because the subject at hand pertains to archetypical ideas about cosmology, and symbols common to them, there must be a certain broadness of scope. William Lethaby defended himself when casting a similarly wide net—pointing out “…the similar needs and desires of men, the necessities imposed by materials, and the physical laws which govern their erection and combination.”\n\n\nThere is no argument here for the continuity of any one, specific tradition, though they will certainly be indicated. That sort of quantifying reductivism; as George Soane said, of ‘weighing sugar against plumbs,’ is a narrowing of scope, and therefore acts against the particular spirit of this inquiry. Material methods are only a single stone in the wall of understanding. Without an architect to supply some Gesamtansicht, a stone is only ever a stone.\n\n\nModern readers face a peculiar difficulty in trying to comprehend the man of antiquity—superstitious and ignorant as we like to imagine him. We pride ourselves on the ability to completely isolate some element of the natural world; to rob it of its integration with its surroundings, and once the taxidermist is done with it, we theorize endlessly as to the rational meaning of its motionlessness. The torment of the existentialists—those most modern men—was the inability of the rational faculty to chain the spirit to a petty linguistic configuration. For this reason does Plato remark in his seventh epistle, that “—whenever one sees a man’s written compositions … these are not his most serious works.”\n   \n\nBut for the man of antiquity, the eye was a thing which emitted its own rays, sympathetic to the light of the sun. Our inward perception of reality was a result of an interaction between object and individual—not simply a passive action by object, upon individual. To lift aside the veil  of industrialization and gain an earnest, historical empathy for the symbol itself, we ought to dispense with the contemporary prejudice that a thing is either physical, or that there is no such thing. We will have to outgrow the view that metaphysics are synonymous with superstition. Nietzsche wrote, of man after industry:\n\n \n\n“We modern men, very delicate, very vulnerable, and paying and receiving consideration in a hundred ways, imagine in fact that this sensitive humanity which we represent … is a positive advance, that with this we have gone far beyond the men of the Renaissance. But every age thinks this way, has to think this way. What is certain is that we would not dare to place ourselves in Renaissance circumstances, or even imagine ourselves in them: our nerves could not endure that reality, not to speak of our muscles. This incapacity, however, demonstrates not an advance, but only a different, a more belated constitution, a weaker, more delicate, more vulnerable one, out of which is engendered a morality which is full of consideration.”\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nCosmology\n\n​\n\n1\nTo primordial man, careful astronomical measure established that the motion of the sky was circular in nature, and therefore, axially organized. The apparent circumpolar motion of the heavenly sphere—of the stars and planetary bodies—described a universal axis in the form of two qualities: verticality, and centrality. Both taken together established an ancient heirophany, which is exemplified in the architecture of the tower.\n\n​\n\n2\nCentrality is analogous to the single point of perception. Outward from that perceptive point—the observer, the eye, the mortal mind—the circle of the horizon was traced, which described the base of the implicit dome of the firmament. In this way did man construct his fundamental structural metaphor, the squared circle. The symbolic combination of terrestrial square and celestial circle is the most basic linkage between the internal, human perceptive faculties and the external architecture of the world.\n\n​\n\n3\nOwing to the circular nature of the sky, and to its motion, it follows first that the pillar of the earth is assimilated to the center of both the celestial planes and the terrestrial plane, like an axle drives the wheels of a chariot. Second, the pillar is understood to support—upon a mundane foundation—the ouranic edifice(s). Third, the pillar constitutes a connection between the realms; what is overhead, and what is underfoot. Therefore the pillar is associated with the cosmic and earthly centers, with the structure or architecture of the cosmos, and with a direct connection between the two; mortal and immortal.\n\n​\n\n4\nIt’s crucial to understand that the sympathetic bond between the lower and higher realms was not only mediated by the human intellect, but was predicated upon it.\n\n​\n\n5\nThe notion that the soul descends from the heavens at birth, and ascends to the heavens at death is common to a great many traditions. The Neoplatonists contended that the model was of considerable antiquity. Porphyry clearly connected the portals through which passage was made to the solstices. Although institutional historians may scratch their chins and tap their ledgers impatiently at much of the Neoplatonic corpus, the solstitial association’s essential features are identifiable with Chaldean traditions. It appears in versions of Akkadian, Babylonian, and Sumerian myths, and can be identified in many Indo-European traditions as well—chief among them the Hellenic, and Nordic. Distilling the writings of Porphyry and Macrobius on the subject, Peter Mark Adams explains:\n\n​\n\n“Each soul being assigned to one star, the ‘home’ of souls was identified with the dense band of stars that constitute the Milky Way. A second band of stars, the zodiac, is identified by the path of the sun and the planets as they cross the heavens. At each of these points they form the shape of the heavenly X.”\n\n​\n\n6\nAt birth, the soul was thought to emerge from the highest sphere of the fixed stars and descend toward earth. As it fell, it passed through the spheres of influence belonged to each of the planetary bodies. Crossing through the realms of each luminary, the soul was clad in some humane quality, or stripped of divine quality, successively taking on the likeness of a mortal man toward birth. Those ancient, Western epistemologies which are broadly gathered up under the term ‘astrology’ owe their lineage to this structure of rationale. The birth of the mortal soul was, in this sense, the death and transmutation of the immortal soul—or its fall—and vice versa. In death the soul-fire reached upward, stripped of its mortal humanity, or purified by the garnering of lost divinity at each of the seven planetary spheres, emerging at last into the heavens again. \n\n​\n\n7\nThe pillar of the earth is divided into twin aspects; twin pillars; two towers, which pertain to the mystical gates through which passage and transmutation is undertaken by the soul at birth, and death, respectively. \n\n​\n\n8\nThe tower is the mature, architectural formulation of these ancient cosmological principles. Its sibling aspects are expressed in the form of two essential qualities: Esoteric wisdom, and the vivifying feminine. The feminine element belongs to the descending gateway, or pillar—to birth; and the masculine element belongs to the ascending gateway, to death. As Porphyry writes, “natural philosophers named these the Gates of the Sun.”\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nMaid\n\n​\n\n9\nThe feminine gateway; the tree of life, or the descending solstitial pillar, is that along which the soul is incarnate. For the Chaldeans, the goddess Ishtar travels down to the underworld, symbolizing the death of the immortal soul and its subsequent birth into the chthonic plane. Along her way, she is stripped of seven garments, representative of the shedding of her divinity in seven stages, until at last she is admitted in her nakedness—just as the infant is admitted to life.\n\n​\n\n10\nAs agriculture is an intercession by man into the labor of nature; in the renewal of life—or the process of cultivating life—we can understand the entanglement of the maiden’s tower with the sacred garden. The common association between feminine divinity and bovine imagery, and with the horns of the crescent moon, is belonged to this agrarian sympathy. It hardly need be said that the lunar affinity is, at a primeval level, likened to the menstrual cycle. It’s no coincidence that Ishtar sends the Bull of Heaven after Gilgamesh for refusing her romantic advances.\n\n​\n\n11\nWhere the feminine tower occurs, so does the paradisiacal garden. Even so early as the Egyptian myths of Setne Khamwas, the prince journeys to the ‘lofty house’ of the priestess Tabubue at Bubastis, which is enclosed by a high wall, and within which the tower is encircled by a sacred garden. Similarly, the Judeo-Christian tradition of the Virgin Mary in hortus conclusus identifies Mary mother of Christ with the tower; Mary of the Column, surrounded by a high wall and the garden of paradise—indicative of perfect fertility in the form of the immaculate conception.\n\n​\n\n12\nThe symbolic garden, within which and over which we tend to find looming the symbolic tower, is to agriculture what architecture is to construction. In other words, as gardening was so often a deeply esoteric form of agriculture, architecture was a deeply esoteric form of building. Of course, the word paradise comes down to us from an Avestan tongue, ‘pairidaeza,’ which translates most nearly to garden, park, or enclosure. In the arcane garden we see curated an heirophany of perfect vivificare, emblematic of the divine feminine. The immaculate conception, far from unique to the Judeo-Christian doctrine, is no more than a supernatural birth—to be understood in tandem with the supernatural death eventually represented by the alchemist at work in his tower—who transfigures himself; or the saint who does not die but rather ascends to heaven right off his feet.\n\n​\n\n13\nIn a lecture delivered at the Rathaus in Zurich, 1869, Gottfreid Semper theorized that the Chaldean planetary tower-temple originated as a pragmatic, military structure. Eventually, he contends, it grew to express the “extreme principle of gradual domination; the royal castle and its Belus temple towering over everything.” However, Semper’s suggestion neglects the fact that the tower was not a symbol peculiar to the Chaldean cosmology. What we see in Semper’s tower as a fortification, is hardly limited to a political metaphor, but rather, the Belus temple is adapted in the feminine gate as a prison or a womb; a place of confinement and transformation. While imprisonment is of course raveled with both the maid and the magus towers, Eliade is able to shed some light on the feminine line of thought, writing: \n\n​\n\n“Very early on we are confronted with the notion that ores ‘grow’ in the belly of the earth after the manner of embryos. … Miner and metalworker intervene in the unfolding of the subterranean embryology: they accelerate the rhythm of the growth of ores, they collaborate in the work of Nature and assist it to give birth more rapidly.”\n\n​\n\nIn Herodotus we find an account of the following Chaldean ritual, perhaps now more clarified, which occurs between a maiden in the tower-temple, and the god Belus—and which he likens to yet other similar rituals:\n\n​\n\n“On the topmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside the temple stands a couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its side. There is no statue of any kind set up in this place, nor is the chamber occupied at nights by anyone but a single woman, who, as the Chaldeans, the priests of this god affirm, is chosen for himself by the deity out of all the women of the land. … They also declare—but for my part I do not credit—that the god comes down in person into this chamber and sleeps upon the couch. This is like the story told by the Egyptians in the city of Thebes, where a woman always passes the night in the temple of the Theban Jupiter (Amon-Ra). In each case the woman is said to be debarred all intercourse with men. It is also like the custom in Lykia, where the priestess who delivers the oracles, during the time that she is so employed … is shut up in the temple every night.”\n\n​\n\n14\nSome aspect of the late-medieval hennin’s form may belong to the tower symbol’s Hermetic resurgence. Worn on the top of the head, with the young woman’s hair tied to a light lappet and wound up into the conical volume—the excess of which was pulled through a small opening at the tip and left to flow freely—the hennin remains synonymous with the archetypal maid. Similar associations between sorcery and conical headdresses are replete for both men and women throughout the Indo-European traditions. Bronze-Age ‘schifferstadt-type’ golden crowns are perhaps the most illustrious example of far-antiquity; each being lavishly decorated with calendrical markers that denote an intricate, celestial function. Herodotus tells us that the Scythians were well-known for such pointed headwear, and names one Scythian tribe tigrakhauda, or ‘people with pointed hats.’ Examples have been found even among the Scythian mummies of the Tarim Basin, in Western China.\n\n​\n\n15\nThe Hermetic maiden exemplifies outward struggle. She shows the chevalier neither what he is, nor what he will become, but rather, intones in his heart only that he must become. The nature of chivalry is not the pursuit of her, but an understanding that she forms the object of right pursuit. She demands of him an affirmation of life. It’s in this sense that Evola refers to the women of the grail-cycle as possessing the vivifying sacrum.\n\n​\n\n16\nThe grail-seeking knight cannot act in order that he win the maiden’s favor; in other words, for his own vanity. In doing so, he succeeds or fails by her word, and therefore her word will always be ‘no.’ He must act in order to preserve her, sacrificially, for his own sense of duty. To defend that sacred place, he must make himself strong, and his sense of self becomes tied to the quality of his charge. In doing so, he succeeds or fails by his own hand, and his hand will, in such a case, always be firm. Thus Evola described power as feminine by nature.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nMage\n\n​\n\n17\nThe pillar of ascension represents the journey back upward to the stellar sphere of divinity. It is the ego-death. The chevalier who achieves symbolic ascension undergoes a transmutation of soul—a doffing of humanity, and a donning of divinity. Symbolic ascension in all of its forms is meant to evoke the re-assimilation of the spirit to the divine, through death, and thus, the achievement of divine wisdom.\n\n​\n\n18\nFire is the key to understanding the tower of the magus. Of the alchemist, and the smith, Eliade writes: “It is with fire that he controls the passage of matter from one state to another.”  This is a crucial, metaphysical component of the funerary pyre, and of the notion of begetting the soul to the afterlife by way of a pillar aflame. As a matter of fact, the word empyrean itself—that which pertains to the highest heaven; which is sublime, exalted, or heavenly—is derived from the ancient Greek word for fire, ‘πυρός.’ Empyrean therefore literally means ‘that which is purely made of fire.’ \n\n​\n\n19\nAccording to the pre-Socratic cosmology of Heraclitus, the nature of water is to flow back to the ocean; the nature of stone is to fall back to the earth; and fire likewise reaches upward, toward the celestial flames of heaven.\n\n​\n\n20\nFire is the agent of change—the thing which allows the feeble hands of men to grasp and work with the connate tools of nature, by which all alchemical processes are conducted, and through which all materials are given to transmutation. The so-called flame of the enlightened saints emerges from this same line of reasoning. The head, wreathed in flame; the solar discs of both crown and halo; indicates the journey undertaken by the master who has experienced reconstitution with the demiurge, and therefore, possesses esoteric knowledge. \n\n​\n\n21\nAs the potter and the smith ‘collaborate in the work of Nature,’ assisting and accelerating it; manipulating it through understanding and mastery of the laws which govern it, so too does the alchemist intervene in, and manipulate the process of death. Where the potter’s medium is clay, and the forgemaster’s medium is metal, the medium of the mage’s royal art is his own spirit. All are essentially telluric.\n\n​\n\n\n22\nThrough understanding the death-pillar and symbolic fire to be indicative of both physical and metaphysical transmutation, we are able to properly approach the Hermetic Athanor. The Athanor is an object that remains shrouded in some mystery. Of it several things are certain: That it was a furnace, that it was exclusively an alchemical tool used to transmute materials, and that it was characterized by its slow, dependable, uniform burning, which needed little management once lit. The Athanor is typically depicted—across the entire Hermetic corpus—in a manner which is strictly architectural: It always takes the form of a tower, possessed of flame, and attended by the laboring mystic.\n\n​\n\n23\nWe find the allegory of Vortigern’s tower and the boy Merlin in the Historia Brittonum. The King Vortigern, having fled into Wales to escape the conquering Saxons, set about constructing himself a fortress. Part of the royal edifice was to be a tower, although, three times the masons set out to work, only to awaken the next morning and find all of their tools and materials had vanished, and that the masonry had collapsed. Vortigern’s council advised him to seek out a child of immaculate conception, to sacrifice him, and to sprinkle his blood on the foundation stones in order to secure the tower’s construction. The king’s men scoured the country and eventually discovered the child Merlin—whose mother had conceived him without a father. They brought him to Vortigern to be sacrificed, but Merlin was clever and questioned Vortigern as to his motives. He instead revealed to the king that an underground cavern was the true culprit undermining the tower’s foundations. Slumbering around a pool within that cavern were two dragons; one white, the other red. According to Merlin’s prophecy the white dragon represented the Saxons while the red dragon represented the Welsh. Then the wyrms awoke, and warred before the king, resulting in the white dragon eventually being defeated and chased away. \n\n​\n\n24\nConcealed within Merlin’s political prophecy—that of the Saxons’ imminent defeat by the Welsh—there is an alchemical lesson. The dragons represent the fire of the furnace that rages in the bowels of the Athanor, or beneath the tower. The twin wyrms each represent the two rudimentary elements present at the outset of the magnum opus: Sulphur, the red element, and mercury, the white element. Red sulphur is assimilated to the inner-fire of man; and with the sun. Mercury, or ‘liquid silver’ is the converse, lunar element. In the Hermetic tradition, the completion of the Great Work is typically signified by an hermaphroditic figure—the Rebis—which symbolizes the successful re-creation of the bipartite, divine soul. As the spirit before the fall is both male and female, the alchemist who achieves the transmutation of his self; who successfully passes the Platonic serpent before the gateway of his own ego-death; is envisioned as both male and female, at once.\n\n​\n\n25\nThe Hermetic wizard exemplifies inward struggle. He is a psychopomp of a sort; who leads the chevalier to the other-world; the great master to whom one apprentices, and in whom one glimpses the absolute height of all human labor. Like Mithras, seated between the solstices, the magus is a man of the medium—a turmer; a bridge, at the near end of which lay the earthly, and the mundane; the logical word; the petty ecstasy of intellect. At the far end lay the heavenly, and the ouranic; the reverent silence; the divine ecstasy of wisdom."

  "content": "1\nWhen I arrived in Africa, to serve, as you know, in the office of military Tribune of the fourth Legion, under Manius Manilius as consul [1], I desired nothing so much as to meet Masinissa the king [2], who for sufficient reasons [3] stood in the most friendly relation to our family. When I came to him, the old man embraced me with tears, and shortly afterward looked up to heaven and said: “I thank thee, sovereign Sun [4], and all of you lesser lights of heaven, that before I pass away from this life I behold in my kingdom and beneath this roof Publius Cornelius Scipio, whose very name renews my strength, so utterly inseparable from my thought is the memory of that best and most invincible of men who first bore it.” Then I questioned him about his kingdom, and he asked me about our republic; and with the many things that we had to communicate to each other, the day wore away.\n\n​\n\nAt a later hour, after an entertainment of royal magnificence, we prolonged our conversation far into the night, while the old man talked to me about nothing else but Africanus, rehearsing not only all that he had done, but all that he had said. When we parted to go to our rest, sleep took a stronger hold on me than usual, on account both of the fatigue of my journey and of the lateness of the hour. In my sleep, I suppose in consequence of our conversation (for generally our thoughts and utterances by day have in our sleep an effect like that which Ennius describes in his own case as to Homer [5], about whom in his waking hours he was perpetually thinking and talking), Africanus appeared to me, with an aspect that reminded me more of his bust than of his real face. I shuddered when I saw him. But he said: “Preserve your presence of mind, Scipio; be not afraid, and commit to memory what I shall say to you.\n\n​\n\n2\n“Do you see that city, which was brought through me into subjection to the Roman people, but now renews its old hostility, and cannot remain quiet,”—and he showed me Carthage from a high place full of stars, shining and splendid,—“against which you, being little more than a common soldier, are coming to fight? In two years from now you as Consul will overthrow this city, and you will obtain of your own right the surname which up to this time you hold as inherited from me. When you shall have destroyed Carthage, shall have celebrated your triumph over it, shall have been Censor, and shall have traversed, as an ambassador, Egypt, Syria, Asia, and Greece, you will be chosen a second time Consul in your absence, and will put an end to one of the greatest of wars by extirpating Numantia. But when you shall be borne to the Capitol in your triumphal chariot after this war, you will find the State disturbed by the machinations of my grandson. [6]\n\n​\n\n“In this emergency, Africanus, it will behoove you to show your country the light of your energy, genius, and wisdom. But I see at that time, as it were, a double way of destiny. For when your age shall have followed the sun for eight times seven revolutions, and these two numbers [7]—each perfect, though for different reasons—shall have completed for you in the course of nature the destined period, to you alone and to your name the whole city will turn; on you the Senate will look, on you all good citizens, on you the allies, on you the Latini. You will be the one man on whom the safety of the city will rest; and, to say no more, you, as Dictator, must re-establish the State, if you escape the impious hands of your kindred.” [8] Here, when Laelius had cried out, and the rest of the company had breathed deep sighs, Scipio, smiling pleasantly upon them, said, “I beg you not to rouse me from sleep and break up my vision. Hear the remainder of it.”\n\n\n3 \n“But that you, Africanus, may be the more prompt in the defense of the State, know that for all who shall have preserved, succored, enlarged their country, there is a certain and determined place in heaven where they enjoy eternal happiness; for to the Supreme God who governs this whole universe nothing is more pleasing than those companies and unions of men that are called cities. Of these the rulers and preservers, going hence, return hither.”\n\n​\n\nHere I, although I had been alarmed, not indeed so much by the fear of death as by that of the treachery of my own kindred, yet asked whether Paulus, my father, and others whom we supposed to be dead were living. “Yes, indeed,” he replied, “those who have fled from the bonds of the body, like runners from the goal, live; while what is called your life is death. But do you see your father Paulus coming to you?” When I saw him, I shed a flood of tears; but he, embracing and kissing me, forbade my weeping.\n\n​\n\nThen as soon as my tears would suffer me to speak, I began by saying, “Most sacred and excellent father, since this is life, as Africanus tells me, why do I remain on the earth, and not rather hasten to come to you?” “Not so,” said he; “for unless the God who has for his temple all that you now behold, shall have freed you from this prison of the body, there can be no entrance for you hither. Men have indeed been brought into being on this condition, that they should guard the globe which you see in the midst of this temple, which is called the earth; and a soul has been given to them from those eternal fires which you call constellations and stars, which, globed and round, animated with god-derived minds, complete their courses and move through their orbits with amazing speed. You, therefore, Publius, and all rightly disposed men are bound to retain the soul in the body’s keeping, nor without the command of him who gave it to you to depart from the life appointed for man, lest you may seem to have taken flight from human duty as assigned by God. But, Scipio, like this your grandfather [9], like me, your father, cherish justice and that sacred observance of duty to your kind, which, while of great worth toward parents and family, is of supreme value toward your country. Such a life is the way to heaven, and to this assembly of those who have already lived, and, released from the body, inhabit the place which you now see,”—it was that circle that shines forth among the stars in the most dazzling white,—”which you have learned from the Greeks to call the Milky Way.” And as I looked on every side I saw other things transcendently glorious and wonderful. There were stars which we never see from here below, and all the stars were vast far beyond what we have ever imagined. The least of them was that which, farthest from heaven, nearest to the earth, shone with a borrowed light. But the starry globes very far surpassed the earth in magnitude. The earth itself indeed looked to me so small as to make me ashamed of our empire, which was a mere point on its surface.\n\n​\n\n4\nWhile I was gazing more intently on the earth, Africanus said: “How long, I pray you, will your mind be fastened on the ground? Do you not see into the midst of what temples you have come? In your sight are nine orbs, or rather globes, by which all things are held together. One is the celestial, the outermost, embracing all the rest,—the Supreme God himself [10], who governs and keeps in their places the other spheres. In this are fixed those stars which ever roll in an unchanging course. Beneath this are seven spheres which have a retrograde movement, opposite to that of the heavens. One of these is the domain of the star which on earth they call Saturn. Next is the luminary which bears the name of Jupiter, of prosperous and healthful omen to the human race; then, the star of fiery red which you call Mars, and which men regard with terror. Beneath, the Sun holds nearly the midway space [11], leader, prince, and ruler of the other lights, the mind and regulating power of the universe, so vast as to illuminate and flood all things with his light. Him, as his companions, Venus and Mercury follow on their different courses; and in a sphere still lower the moon revolves, lighted by the rays of the sun. Beneath this there is nothing that is not mortal and perishable, except the souls bestowed upon the human race by the gift of the gods. Above the moon all things are eternal. The earth, which is the central and ninth sphere, has no motion, and is the lowest [12] of all, and all heavy bodies gravitate spontaneously toward it.”\n\n​\n\n5\nWhen I had recovered from my amazement at these things I asked, “What is this sound so strong and so sweet that fills my ears?” “This,” he replied, “is the melody which, at intervals unequal, yet differing in exact proportions, is made by the impulse and motion of the spheres themselves, which, softening shriller by deeper tones, produce a diversity of regular harmonies. Nor can such vast movements be urged on in silence; and by the order of nature the shriller notes sound from one extreme of the universe, the deeper from the other. Thus yonder supreme celestial sphere with its clustered stars, as it revolves more rapidly, moves with a shrill and quick strain; this lower sphere of the moon sends forth deeper notes; while the earth, the ninth sphere, remaining motionless [13], always stands fixed in the lowest place, occupying the centre of the universe. But these eight revolutions, of which two, those of Mercury and Venus, are in unison, make seven distinct tones, with measured intervals between, and almost all things are arranged in sevens [14]. Skilled men, copying this harmony with strings and voice, have opened for themselves a way back to this place, as have others who with excelling genius have cultivated divine sciences in human life. But the ears of men are deafened by being filled with this melody; nor is there in you mortals a duller sense than that of hearing. As where the Nile at the Falls of Catadupa pours down from the loftiest mountains, the people who live hard by lack the sense of hearing because of the loudness of the cataract, so this harmony of the whole universe in its intensely rapid movement is so loud that men’s ears cannot take it in, even as you cannot look directly at the sun, and the keenness and visual power of the eye are overwhelmed by its rays.” While I marvelled at these things, I ever and anon cast my eyes again upon the earth.\n\n​\n\n6 \nThen Africanus said: “I perceive that you are now fixing your eyes on the abode and home of men, and if it seems to you small, as it really is, then look always at these heavenly things, and despise those earthly. For what reputation from the speech of men, or what fame worth seeking, can you obtain? You see that the inhabited places of the earth are scattered and of small extent, that in the spots [15]—so to speak—where men dwell there are vast solitary tracts interposed, and that those who live on the earth are not only so separated that no communication can pass from place to place, but stand, in part at an oblique angle, in part at a right angle with you, in part even in an opposite direction [16]; and from these you certainly can anticipate no fame.\n\n \n\n“You perceive also that this same earth is girded and surrounded by belts, two of which—the farthest from each other, and each resting at one extremity on the very pole of the heavens—you see entirely frost-bound; while the middle and largest of them burns under the sun’s intensest heat. Two of them are habitable, of which the southern, whose inhabitants are your antipodes, bears no relation to your people; and see how small a part they occupy in this other northern zone, in which you dwell. For all of the earth with which you have any concern—narrow at the north and south, broader in its central portion—is a mere little island, surrounded by that sea which you on earth call the Atlantic, the Great Sea, the Ocean, while yet, with such a name, you see how small it is. To speak only of these cultivated and well-known regions, could your name even cross this Caucasus which you have in view, or swim beyond that Ganges? Who, in what other lands may lie in the extreme east or west, or under northern or southern skies, will ever hear your name? All these cut off, you surely see within what narrow bounds your fame can seek to spread. Then, too, as regards the very persons who tell of your renown, how long will they speak of it?\n\n​\n\n7\n“But even if successive generations should desire to transmit the praise of every one of us from father to son in unbroken succession, yet because of devastations by flood and fire, which will of necessity take place at a determined time, we must fail of attaining not only eternal fame, but even that of very long duration. Now of what concern is it that those who shall be born hereafter should speak of you, when you were spoken of by none who were born before you, who were not fewer, and certainly were better men?—especially, too, when among those who might hear our names there is not one that can retain the memories of a single year. Men, indeed, ordinarily measure the year only by the return of the sun, that is, one star, to its place; but when all the stars, after long intervals, shall resume their original places in the heavens, then that completed revolution may be truly called a year. As of old the sun seemed to be eclipsed and blotted out when the soul of Romulus entered these temples, so when the sun shall be again eclipsed in the same part of his course, and at the same period of the year and day, with all the constellations and stars recalled to the point from which they started on their revolutions, then count the year as brought to a close [17]. But be assured that the twentieth part of this year has not yet come round.\n\n​\n\n“Therefore, should you renounce the hope of returning to this place in which are all things that great and excellent men can desire, of what worth is that human glory which can scarcely extend to a small part of a single year? If, then, you shall determine to look high up, and to behold continuously this dwelling and eternal home, you will neither give yourself to the flattery of the people, nor place your hope of well-being on rewards that man can bestow. Let Virtue herself by her own charms draw you to true honor. What others may say of you, regard as their concern, not yours. They will doubtless talk about you, but all that they say is confined within the narrow limits of the regions which you now see; nor did such speech as to any one ever last on into eternity,—it is buried with those who die, and lost in oblivion for those who may come afterward.”\n\n​\n\n8\nWhen he had spoken thus, I said, “O Africanus, if indeed for those who have deserved well of their country there is, as it were, an open road by which they may enter heaven, though from boyhood treading in my father’s steps and yours, I have done no discredit to your fame, I yet shall now strive to that end with a more watchful diligence.” And he replied: “Strive [18] indeed, and bear this in mind, that it is not you that are mortal, but your body only. Nor is it you whom this outward form makes manifest; but every man’s mind is he,—not the bodily shape which can be pointed at by the finger. Know also that you are a god, if he indeed is a god who lives, who perceives, who remembers, who foresees, who governs and restrains and moves the body over which he is made ruler even as the Supreme God holds the universe under his sway; and in truth as the eternal God himself moves the universe which is mortal in every part, so does the everlasting soul move the corruptible body.\n\n \n\n“That, indeed, which is in perpetual movement is eternal; but that which, while imparting motion to some other substance, derives its own movement from some other source, must of necessity cease to live when it ceases to move. Then that alone which is the cause of its own motion, because it is never deserted by itself, never has its movement suspended. But for other substances that are moved this is the source, the first cause, [19] of movement. But the first cause has no origin; for all things spring from the first cause: itself, from nothing. That indeed would not be a first cause which derived its beginning from anything else; and if it has no beginning, it never ceases to be. For the first cause, if extinct, will neither itself be born again from aught else, nor will it create aught else from itself, if indeed all things must of necessity originate from the first cause. Thus it is that the first cause of motion is derived from that which is in its nature self-moving; but this can neither be born nor die. Were it to die, the whole heaven would of necessity collapse, and all nature would stand still, nor could it find any force which could be set in movement anew from a primitive impulse. \n\n​\n\n9\n“Since, then, that which is the source of its own movement is manifestly eternal, who is there that can deny that this nature has been given to the soul? For whatever is moved by external impulse is soulless [20]; but whatever has a soul [21] is stirred to action by movement inward and its own; for this is the peculiar nature and virtue of the soul. Moreover, if it is this alone of all things that is the source of its own movement, it certainly did not begin to be, and is eternal. \n\n \n\n“This soul I bid you to exercise in the best pursuits, and the best are your cares for your country’s safety, by which if your soul be kept in constant action and exercise, it will have the more rapid flight to this its abode and home. This end it will attain the more readily, if, while it shall be shut up in the body, it shall peer forth, and, contemplating those things that are beyond, abstract itself as far as possible from the body. For the souls of those who have surrendered themselves to the pleasures of the body, have yielded themselves to their service, and, obeying them under the impulse of sensual lusts, have transgressed the laws of gods and men, when they pass out of their bodies are tossed to and fro around the earth, nor return to this place till they have wandered in banishment for many ages.”\n\n​\n\nHe departed; I awoke from sleep.\n\n​\n\nend.\n\n \n\nNotes\n\n \n\n1. The praenomen Marcus is given to Manilius in the manuscript of the De Republics discovered by Angelo Mai; but Manius is the reading in all previous authorities as to this special fragment.\n\n\n2. King of Numidia, a country nearly identical in extent with the present province of Algeria. Its name defines its people, being derived from [Greek: nomades]\n \n\n3. The elder Africanus had confirmed him in the possession of his own Numidia, and had added to it the adjoining kingdom of Cirta.\n \n\n4. The Numidians worshipped the heavenly bodies\n \n\n5. The first verse of the Annales of Ennius was:--“In somnis mihi visus Homerus adesse poeta.”\n \n\n6. Tiberius Gracchus, whose mother, Cornelia, was the daughter of the elder Africanus.\n \n\n7. The Pythagoreans regarded seven as the number representing light, and eight as representing love. Seven was also a perfect number, as corresponding to the number of celestial orbits (including the sun, the moon, and the five known planets), the number of days in the quarter of the moon's revolution, and the number of the gates of sense (so to speak), mouth, eyes, ears, and nostrils. Eight was a perfect number, as being first after unity on the list of cubes; and Plato in the Timaeus speaks of eight celestial revolutions--including that of the earth--as unequal in duration and velocity, but as forming, in some unexplained way, a cycle synchronous with the year.\n \n\n8. See De Amicitia § 3, note.\n \n\n9. By adoption. The younger Africanus was adopted by a son of the elder.\n \n\n10. Here crops out the Pantheism--the non-detachment or semi-detachment of God from nature--which casts a penumbra around monotheism and the approaches to it, almost always, except under Hebrew and Christian auspices.\n \n\n11. The middle, as the fifth of the nine spheres, enclosed by four; and enclosing four.\n \n\n12. The lowest because central, and therefore farthest from the outermost or celestial sphere.\n \n\n13. Therefore without sound.\n \n\n14. Latin, qui numerus (that is, septem) rerum omnium fere nodus est. Literally, \"which number is the knot of almost everything.\" The more intelligible form in which I have rendered these words seems to me to convey their true meaning, and my belief to that effect is confirmed by reading what several commentators say about the passage.\n \n\n15. Latin, maculis,--a figure so bold in Cicero's time as to need an apology for its use, but now employed with no consciousness of its being otherwise than strictly literal.\n \n\n16. It hardly needs to be said, that the reference here is to the convex surface of the earth, on which those remote from one another may hold all the various angles to each other that are borne by the spokes of a wheel.\n \n\n17. The Stoics maintained that the visible universe would last through such a cycle as is here described, which in their conjectural astronomy comprehended many thousands of years, and then would be consumed by fire, or somehow be reduced to chaos, and a new universe take its place.\n \n\n18. Or, you will strive indeed.\n \n\n19. Latin, principium.\n \n\n20.Latin, inanimum.\n \n\n21.Latin, animal. My renderings of inanimum and animal here, if not justified by any parallel instances (and I know not whether they are), are required by the obvious meaning of the sentence."

  "content": "Galeotto Roberto Malatesta was born in 1411 to Pandolfo III, and was first in line to succeed his father for lordship of Rimini. His brother Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta was six years younger, and born to a different mother. At the age of only thirteen, Sigismondo fought to defend Rimini against their uncle, who challenged the young Galeotto’s succession.\n\n\nDuring the attempted rebellion organized by their uncle, Carlo II Malatesta, of Pesaro—in which their estate was seized—Sigismondo and his brother were taken captive. While Galeotto prayed for deliverance, the young Sigismondo armed himself and managed to fight free of his captors. Having successfully escaped into the nearby countryside, Sigismondo delivered an impassioned speech, and was able to rally a formidable force to the defense of his family’s right to rule—all in that same night. It was this initial military victory that took him from the second son of a man-at-arms, to a condottiero of national repute. Where Galeotto’s piety absolved him of any attachment to the situation, Sigismondo’s sense of valor required that he shoulder the danger alone.\n\n \n\n“Waving your spear, you prayed to the gods and encouraged your men. Looking upon the threshold of ethereal Olympus, you began to summon the gods and make vows. I pray to you, o gods, guardians of Italy, ever the greatest spirits, you who have favored Romulus’ city and people, and you, Vesta, protector of the robed Roman, banish this madness from your lands. I, Sigismondo, will adorn your altars with great gifts and hold long parades.” \n\n​\n\nBasinio Basini; letter in praise of Sigismondo Malatesta, c. 1449\n\n​\n\nAs the distance between Galeotto and his responsibilities widened, he committed himself to the Franciscans to pursue life as an ascetic. Lordship of Rimini was passed to Sigismondo as a result of his brother’s abdication. Sigismondo was quickly apprenticed to Franceso Sforza following his victory over his uncle. Sforza was another man who had won his station through skill rather than birthright, and he trained Sigismondo in the varied arts of war. In many ways, Sforza showed Sigismondo the means to cut his way to glory. So impressed was he with Sigismondo’s talent as a soldier, that he offered is own daughter, Polissena, to be his second wife—to ensure he would never have to meet Sigismondo on the field. Still, Sigismondo waged war twice against Sforza before finally saving him from the Aragonese invasion.\n\n\nLeft to his own aims Galeotto would never have risen to his worldly duties, nor have accepted his inherited office. He was a deeply religious man and aspired, above all, to true Christian virtues: Humility and poverty. In joining the Franciscan order he refused his succession, choosing instead to recuse himself completely from all material, and worldly attachments. In point of fact, he had to be convinced by the clergy to exercise any of his familial powers, and further, even to marry. His wife’s apparent devotion to Galeotto speaks well of him as a husband; she asked to be buried beside him, and took no other husband in the decades that separated their deaths. Still, there is no evidence the marriage ever produced any heirs. Sigismondo, by contrast, took three wives in his life. His love for the third—Isotta—remains legendary, and was immortalized in much of the artwork he patroned.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nGaleotto made it his duty to see to the poor of Rimini, and nourished them as he could. Above the objections of his confessor, and even to the extent of a direct rebuke from Pope Eugenius the IV, Galeotto abstained from the political realm entirely. He was known to clothe himself in horsehair, and mortified his own flesh daily. Galeotto elected only the comfort of a wooden plank on which to sleep at night. An infected wound on his foot, which never healed, supplied another avenue for his contemplative masochism. What miracles are ascribed to him reflect his wounded constitution; being miracles of healing, and laying on hands. While Galeotto’s piety was officially recognized by the Church, he was never canonized. His brother, however, was excommunicated—twice.\n   \n\nSigismondo, though highly regarded as a soldier, was initially denied command of the Italian forces contesting the Aragonese claim being pressed against his old master, Sforza, in Milan. He therefore accepted a contract from the invaders to lay siege to Florence. Even as he rallied his forces he was prevailed upon by the ambassador of Milan to take up arms again, to defend his fatherland. Considering himself a descendant of the legendary Scipio Africanus and heir to his legacy, Sigismondo betrayed his contract with the Spanish king, and used his forces instead to defend the Milanese confederation. His leadership was widely vaunted, even by the most dire of his enemies, many of whom put their grudges with him on hold, in order to fight with him whenever the opportunity arose. Sigismondo’s decision to defend the Milanese confederation is emblematic of his legacy; a balancing act between base treachery, and the principled defense of his homeland. Sigismondo’s actions raised the fury of Alfonso, king of Aragon, and caused Rimini to be singularly excluded from the peace treaty, which Alfonso brokered with the states that Sigismondo had saved.\n   \n\nThe Tuscan wars provided the field, the moment, and the enemy for Sigismondo to solidify his legacy as one of Italy’s fiercest military commanders. Many of his most legendary victories were won against French and Spanish invasions into Italy, and the common people of Italy rallied behind his leadership. The same Pope who castigated Galeotto for failing in his duties to the realm, praised Sigismondo’s decisive hand at war.\n\n \n\n“No one except you, Sigismondo, wishes to keep evil wars from our lands, in your ancient devotion you alone defend Italy.”\n\n​\n\nPope Eugenius IV\n\n​\n\nHis competence, not only as a man-at-arms but as a leader of soldiery, was so noteworthy that the Pope commissioned him to lead his own standing forces as condottiero for a short time. Across his career, he was hired to lead the forces of nearly every major power in Italy; of Florence, Venice, Milan, Siena, Naples and the Church—his native Rimini being held in fief as a Papal state. Most masters who employed Sigismondo at one time, also faced him across the battlefield on another. On some occasions, he even went on to serve under them again, afterward. \n   \n\nWhile Galeotto’s life was considerably shorter than Sigismondo’s, passing at the age of twenty-one, he delivered himself voraciously to the cloth. And although scorn was eventually heaped upon Sigismondo to a degree which is utterly unique in the whole history of Christendom, it cannot be said that he was any less devoted to his own ethic. Galeotto’s humility might rightly be called ‘modern’ in comparison to his brother’s earthly, active sense of war and heroism. Sigismondo’s Neoplatonic mentality; his pagan idealism is, in fact, what earned him his second excommunication.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nIn one peculiar episode, Sigismondo had the bones of the Byzantine Neoplatonic philosopher Plethon exhumed from his resting place, and transferred to a new crypt in his own Tempio—which was designed by the renowned architect Leon Battista Alberti. Plethon was a controversial figure even in his own time. The scholar George of Trebizond wrote, of Plethon: \n\n​\n\n“I myself heard him at Florence ... asserting that in a few more years the whole world would accept one and the same religion with one mind, one intelligence, one teaching. And when I asked him “Christ’s or Muhammad’s?,” he said, “Neither; but it will not differ much from paganism.” I was so shocked by these words that I hated him ever after and feared him like a poisonous viper, and I could no longer bear to see or hear him.”\n\n​\n\nThe exact nature of Sigismondo’s interest in pagan spiritualism is elusive. He was portrayed, and portrayed himself—through the efforts of artists, sculptors, and architects he commissioned—as though the figure of Homeric legend. He is depicted in the company of the Roman pantheon, presented as marching in triumphal procession and acting as a beacon of imperious virtue. Within the chapel of ancestors in the Tempio Malatestiano, Sigismondo had the triumph of Scipio Africanus rendered into marble relief, with Scipio bearing his own facial features. Though his artists made occasional references to the one God on high, Sigismondo’s exploits are steeped in occult imagery, to the outspoken irritation of his contemporaries—and in sharp contrast to the character of his brother. Sigismondo’s sense of chivalric virtue was confirmed by his living triumph, where Galeotto’s piety was cemented only with his impoverished death in isolation. \n   \n\nSigismondo was able to lead his men against nearly twice their number, and by careful maneuver, patient timing, and the tactical application of artillery—was able to force victory in situations his recalcitrant employers considered impossible. His success was defined by strength, by the knowing application of violence, and by the administration of deception. None of these virtues feature in Galeotto’s doctrinal conception of all morality being derived from the example of Christ. However, they were at the heart of Sigismondo, as viewed in the eyes of Jupiter, Mars, and Minerva and by extrapolation, his highest aspirations for himself as a man.\n\n​\n\n“All the gods favor you, you are Italians. Dare now to boast of your ancient lineage and the first Romans. Defend this great name for yourselves, draw your swords and flatten these barbarian armies. We do not see here Hannibal and the arms of savage Carthage, the tough Numidians, or the wild Jugurtha. This barbarian race and mob is the lowest dregs of humanity.”\n\n​\n\nFrom a Speech attributed to Sigismondo in 1448, by Basinio Basini, during the Aragonese invasion of Tuscany\n\n​\n\nThough the name “The Wolf of Rimini” is arguably apocryphal, it captures his reputation for unpredictable ferocity. With his exclusion from the Peace of Lodi, he was made vulnerable to all his old rivals including the rebel branch of the Malatestas, and his most notable competitor: His neighbor, and antagonist Federico III de Montefeltro. All the great powers in Italy were incentivized by Sigimondo’s exclusion from the peace to take him apart. The situation was made worse by the election of a Spanish Pope, and then, of a Pope friendly to Montefeltro—resulting in serious political problems for Sigismondo.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nOn April 27th, 1462, Sigismondo Malatesta was excommunicated for the second time, was confirmed damned, and canonized directly into Hell—while he was still alive. This event is unique in the history of the Catholic Church, and impressive considering the fact that his brother was beatified. Sigismondo’s fortunes failed thereafter, and his Tempio Malatestiano was never completed. Rimini, however, would survive to be inherited by his sons.\n\n​\n\n“This is Sigismondo Malatesta, king of traitors, enemy of God and man, condemned to fire by the decision of the sacred college.” \n\n​\n\nInscribed on the three placards which were burned with three life sized effigies of Sigismondo Malatesta in Rome, after his trial in absentia.\n\n​\n\nIn a final ironic parity between the brothers Malatesta, Galeotto died young and uncompromising in virtue—as a warrior might—while Sigismondo passed on advanced in years. The Wolf of Rimini died diminished in body and estate, by constant attrition; in reflective seclusion at his residence. An essential similarity between the two of them is accented by their radical disparity. Sigismondo and Galeotto were each singularly driven men, who inspired admiration from their contemporaries by the colossal force of ideological dedication. Neither man was free of vice, and neither would argue that one could be, though, both had direct, personal ambition to divinity. Through the trials of asceticism or the tribulations of war, each brother sought that crucible, which, in accordance with his own nature, might transmute the mortal soul.\n   \n\nWhat is perhaps most astonishing is the fact that both Galeotto and Sigismondo were unmade by the same chthonic imperfection: Hubris. In his spiritual asperity Galeotto was so disdainful of the mundane, that he alienated himself from all the tools at his disposal to further the gospel. Likewise, Sigismondo was a sword so sharp with ambition that he cut all those who sought to wield him. While Galeotto felt that he was beyond the criticism of his own clergy, his disregard for his own health and duty ultimately delivered his realm into the imperiled hands of his brother. Sigismondo’s titanic martial propensity in turn led him to accept no master above himself, and he eventually became less useful to the higher forces at war than another general-for-hire without such grand, abstract aspirations.\n   \n\nIn writing the treatise that came to define an era of warrior- monks, long before the time of the Malatestas, St. Bernard of Clairveaux observed:\n\n \n\n“This, I repeat, is a new kind of knighthood and one unknown in ages past. It indefatigably wages a twofold combat, against flesh and blood, and against a spiritual hosts of evil in the heavens. ... Indeed, danger or victory for a Christian depends on the focus of his heart, and not on the fortunes of war.”"

  "content": "The most feared army in all of Greece was broken in Boeotia, on the field between Thespiae and Plataea, in 371 BC. There, Cleombrotus I became the first Spartan king to fall in combat since Leonidas perished at Thermopylae. With him faded the Laconian hegemony that ruled the region from the end of the Peloponnesian War. The battle at Leuctra was unavoidable, and historians argued over Leuctra even while it was still in living memory. Modern historians continue to disagree as to specifically how the battle was won by the Thebans, or as to the precise moment, or reason for why the Spartans lost.\n   \n\nThe narrative by which we organize history is a difficult mixture of fact, and of social, political, or moral apocrypha. Those moments in the past that seem to us to be most decisive, tend to be difficult to apprehend upon close inspection; either due to the innate complexity of historical crossroads, or because of their resultant over-handling by historians. Pivotal events become yardsticks of the zeitgeist. \n   \n\nThe virtues supported by one particular telling come in-and-out of fashion, and Leuctra is not well served by the tendency of institutional historians to treat it as a neatly-drawn fable: A tyrannical rule came to a sudden end. A peerless army was defeated. The tenacious but less-formidable soldiery found an opening through cunning, and seized it with act of bravery. The situation is made worse still because the famed and traditional discipline of the Spartans, together with the eccentric tactical strategies of the Thebans, came to represent a modern tendency—to conceive of important moments in history according to a ‘progressive’ frame of mind, and then to celebrate the Thebans for it, as if it justifies us. \n   \n\nThe political condition at the end of the Peloponnesian War is better described as a state of exhaustion, than a decisive conclusion—as evidenced by the Corinthian War. Following the failure of more direct means of control at Marathon, Persia engaged in a host of political games, in an attempt to blunt the Greek powers against one another. Such political machinations generally ensured that no true supremacy could feasibly take shape in Greece among the warring city-states. When the Peloponnesian War finally drew to a grueling conclusion the Persians then shifted their support away from Sparta, and over to the remaining city-states. Athens overthrew its installed government, and then returned to war—facilitated not only by the Persians, but also by the Spartans’ own ungenerous treatment of their allies during the Peloponnesian War. The scorned cities, specifically Thebes, found enough success fighting alongside the Athenians against the Spartans, that the Persians felt it worth their while to lend their support to the Laconians once more. It was a switch that led Athens to seek an end to the war. Thebes, however, was again left somewhat unfulfilled in its appeasements by the treaty. The Theban desire to consolidate its power over central Greece, and of Sparta to do the same, lead both to seek a political excuse to resolve the question of who would rule, for themselves. As history would have it however, the Theban-Spartan conflict resulted in a new hierarchy of power dominated by neither; but by Macedonia in the north.\n   \n\nThe heart of ancient Greek soldiery was the hoplite; a heavy infantryman levied from citizenry who were wealthy enough to equip themselves. He comprised the central fighting force of every city-state. The hoplite’s primary arms were the broad circular shield, a spear roughly ten-foot in length, and his sidearms. Traditionally, Greek military tactics were dedicated with almost exclusive focus on the disposition of the hoplites on the field, who were seen as the decisive element of battle. Other troops—skirmishers and cavalry—were treated moreso as a tangential detail; an attitude exemplified in Spartan war-making, as they were unequalled in the prosecution of those tactics and fielded the finest hoplites in the peninsula. Such a philosophy however, meant that skirmishers were frequently relegated to mercenary troops and that the Spartans only adopted their own cavalry corps late in the Peloponnesian War. \n   \n\nIn sharp contrast with their heavy infantry, Spartan cavalry was ill-trained and poorly equipped. There was a certain lack of prestige for a cavalryman in Laconia, and because of the demanding resource-requirements for maintaining horses, often the circumstance was that men of low station were issued horses belonged to infantrymen during the campaign, to serve as cavalry themselves. The result was a cavalry largely composed of men with next-to-no skills in horsemanship; men who were neither acquainted with fighting from horseback, nor in formation. Thus far, the questionable quality of the Spartan cavalry was vindicated by the potency of the Spartan phalanx—a tight formation of hoplites which allowed more disciplined soldiers to support one-another through drilled formation, which minimized the reliance of the army on individual skill and numerical advantage. A well-maintained phalanx could easily resist assault by any contemporary cavalry, provided it was attacked from the front. The primary weakness of a phalanx was its slow, and ungainly capacity for turning itself—a point which proved crucial at the battle of Leuctra. \n   \n\nBecause the Spartan phalanx was only properly vulnerable to attack from the flanks, the Spartan cavalry only ever needed to be fit enough to secure the hoplites’ flanks for long enough, that the hoplites could win the battle. It is precisely because of the Spartan’s tactical success that the leaders of the Boeotian league were pressured to find some nuance in their own engagement strategy, rather than to try and beat the Laconians at their own game.\n   \n\nThe Theban scheme at Leuctra should perhaps more accurately be described as the tactics of Epaminondas himself, a Beaotarch of the Boeotian League and general of the Theban armies. He is regarded, now, as one of the preeminent military minds of his time—though many of the details of his life have been lost to history. A reserved and reclusive man by nature, Epaminondas is thought to have been drawn into the political sphere because of his close friendship with Pelopidas, who was a prominent Theban politician. While Epaminondas was responsible for the disposition of all of Thebes’ might, it was his friend, Pelopidas, who led the most elite contingent of Theban hoplites: The Sacred Band. \n   \n\nGreece had been in a state of war for verging on a century by this point, and Thebes fielded an established core of hardened veterans not only within their infantry, but also their cavalry. Theban horsemen were used to working in concert with heavy infantry, but they also fought with a unique group of light infantry skirmishers who were mobile enough to act in unison with the horsemen. In a perhaps inelegant summation, it could be said that the Thebans were strong where Sparta was weak, and where the Spartans were peerless, the Thebans remained formidable. \n   \n\nThus far, mention of the allied states and of the mercenaries fighting alongside both belligerents has been avoided, not only because they were secondary actors, but because the details of the battle bear out a lack of wherewithal among them. Through attrition, the rest of Greece was content to let Sparta and Thebes determine between themselves who would reign. The formations deployed at Leuctra allowed this exchange to take place, in such a way that the Thebans and Spartans only bloodied themselves.\n   \n\nKing Cleombrotus I of Sparta positioned his campaigning force to strike at Thebes well before Epaminondas even refused to sign the treaty—written to prevent the outbreak of war. Both seemingly decided, then, that force was the only way to answer the question of power between them. No sooner did the Boeotian League leave negotiations than did Cleombrotus’ readied force circumvent a fortified defile on the border of Boeotia—having marched through a mountain pass—and seized several naval vessels. The Spartan king was suddenly within direct striking range of Thebes, when he was confronted by Epaminondas on a flat plain outside the village of Leuctra. \n   \n\nThe Theban general did not want a siege. He believed a pitched battle was their best chance at victory. Also of consideration for Epaminondas was the reluctance of other Boeotians to fight. Epaminondas had to either use his army now, or lose it. Similarly, across the field King Cleombrotus was operating under the weight of political antagonism from home, in Laconia. His respect for Thebes as an opponent was well-known, and provided his political enemies with an avenue to create the narrative that he was soft on the Boeotian league. Even his closest advisors believed that if he did not face Epaminondas in battle, he would face exile upon his return. \n   \n\nThough the precise figures are disputed, both forces were evenly matched at roughly 10,000 men. And while it’s generally agreed that the Spartans and their allies outnumbered the Thebans, we must also consider that Theban cavalry specifically outnumbered the Spartan cavalry. Additionally, of the Spartan-led force only some 2,000 originated from Laconia, and of those, only 700 were Spartan citizens. With odds this close, either commander might have preferred to avoid a pitched battle in favor of pursuing a diplomatic resolution more heavily in their favor. However, political pressures on both sides required a more visceral conclusion to the conflict. \n   \n\nFor the Spartans, the formation was a matter of consistent, tactical precision. Hoplites would be arrayed in phalanxes roughly eight men deep, with the most disciplined and experienced troops down the right side of the line. Such a traditional formation worked to avoid the tendency of less-disciplined phalanxes to wain right, exposing the flank to the enemy. By stationing the Royal Guard and his most experienced hoplites on the right, Cleombrotus could keep the entire band in reliable formation. The Spartans’ plan was to outmatch and defeat the opposing Boeotian hoplites, and to expose the Theban flank—the assumption being that the Theban formation would mirror the Spartan formation. For the Thebans not to do so, would jeopardize their phalanx for the same reason, and risk a total route by the superior Spartan infantry. Cleombrotus’ skirmishers and cavalry were to be positioned to secure the heavy infantry from disruption by enemy cavalry and skirmishers. These strategic configurations enjoyed traditional status because deviation from them led so frequently to defeat. \n   \n\nEpaminondas, however, deployed several variations from traditional formation in an attempt to manage the threat posed by the prowess of the Spartan Royal Guard. First, he reinforced the Sacred Band with troops from the other Boeotians. Whereas the phalanxes deployed by the Spartans were about eight men deep, Pelopidas led a phalanx fifty men deep. What’s more, he led it from the Theban left, directly into king Cleombrotus and the Spartan Royal Guard. Next, in order to keep the skirmishing elements of his army from having to engage; in order to draw out the inevitable disarray among those flightier soldiers—which was sure to result from his eccentric tactics—Epaminondas staggered them backward, at an angle, away from the Spartan line, so as to still cover the right flank of the Sacred Band. The other Spartan troops, therefore, could neither support the Royal Guard without exposing their flank to the staggered Theban line, nor could they easily engage the inferior soldiery because of the distance. The Theban formation was thus able to narrow the crux of the battle from the full line of two engaging armies, down to just the two engaged phalanxes: The reinforced Sacred Band, and the Spartan Royal Guard. In essence, this maneuver took back the numerical advantage for the Thebans by an impressive margin. \n \n\nIt is important to note that Epaminondas’ formations are not entirely without precedent in the history of Greek military engagement—even recent to the battle at Leuctra—but were not in concert, and such tactics were often the result of necessity moreso than cunning. Epaminondas’ eccentric deployment at Leuctra is the primary reason for his general acclaim. The story is tidy: A force which could not be defeated, laid low because of daring new tactics; it clearly demonstrates the virtue of progress, and of innovative thinking—triumphant over rigid traditionalism and ignominy. It is a neat enough parable, but moreover, one which does away with enough of the reality of the battlefield, as to be useful only if one has motives beyond the historical. This is because of the last, and most important, feature of the Theban deployment at Leuctra—the cavalry. \n   \n\nThe problem with deploying a phalanx much deeper than twelve men, is that the weakness of its vulnerable flank becomes less and less manageable as the phalanx deepens. The longer the flank is, the more exposed it is, and the more difficult it is for the phalanx to maneuver reliably and defend itself. Each line added to the phalanx, while adding momentum and support toward the front, is an exponential liability. One of the simplest reasons that a phalanx was rarely deployed anywhere nearly as deeply as the Theban formation, was the expectation that it would be flanked and summarily routed. The longer the flank, the more area there is to engage the formation on the edges, where it is weakest. Such a deep phalanx desperately invited the enemy to outmaneuver it—and, its depth and ungainly configuration would disallow the unit to turn and face the flanking attack in tandem. Future adaptations of this tactic involved much deeper consideration and variation given to the security of armies’ flanks. The Spartans would have been intimately aware of this fact, even upon seeing Epaminondas’ deployment on the field. Cleombrotus moved immediately to use the odd Theban formation against them to devastating effect, and would have, had the Royal Guard’s flanking maneuver not been interrupted by the Spartans’ own cavalry.\n   \n\nEpaminondas placed his cavalry directly in front of his lines, rather than locating them more traditionally along the flanks. While this positioning might seem counter-intuitive; exposing the flank of the already precariously deep phalanx, it provided them an advantage specific to the Theban deployment at Leuctra. Should the Spartans attempt to reform in order to find the flank of Epaminondas’ deep phalanx, the Theban cavalry would be right there to intervene with the infantry. Thus, Cleombrotus was forced to deploy his own cavalry in front of his lines as well, to screen against that Theban tactic. \n   \n\nWith this single move, the Spartan cavalry suddenly went from a tangential detail of the battle to a crucial component—a role for which they were completely unprepared, especially against the Thebans; the finest cavalry in Greece. \n   \n\nThe Thebans utterly crushed the Spartan cavalry. Their victory in the skirmish was so decisive that they not only routed the Spartans, but encircled them. They drove the Spartan cavalry back over their own lines, and shattered Cleombrotus’ infantry formation as it attempted to maneuver into a position to punish Epaminondas, and his eccentric phalanx. The Spartan hoplites were left to fight in individual disarray when Pelopidas and the Scared Band collided with the heart of the Spartan line. \n   \n\nThe fighting was brutal, and the charge stalled until king Cleombrotus was mortally wounded. Despite the fact that the Spartans couldn’t have been in worse position to receive the charge of the deepened phalanx, they still controlled the field well enough to allow Cleombrotus to withdraw to their camp, but at devastating cost. Nearly 400 of the 700 Spartan citizens—an already dearly winnowed population from the continuous wars—were slain. When Spartan allied forces saw that Cleombrotus had fallen, they abandoned the field. The battle was ended in a resounding victory for Thebes. Cleombrotus died on the field of his wounds.\n   \n\nWhile the victory allowed Thebes to invade the Spartan homeland, and to free many of their slaves in a manner ruinous to their economy, it did not lead to a decisive conclusion to the war. Epaminondas died soon after by a Spartan sword at the tip of his new formation, while laying siege to the Laconians, in their fourth attempt to invade the Peloponnesus. Thebes established dominance over Greece, but lost much of its martial nuance with the death of its preeminent general. The enduring victory was for foreign powers. Persia was free to manage its affairs without Greek meddling, or fear a united Hellenic army. Macedon, under Philip, was then eventually able to lay claim to each of the exhausted city states, save Sparta. Sparta only gave way at last to Philip’s son, some years on. \n \n\nIt’s a decidedly less compelling story—the idea that when the legendary warriors of Sparta were finally defeated; when the Spartan hegemony was ended on the battlefield, it was a consequence of decisions made decades before rather than the result of one daring general’s unorthodox mentality. The lens of history has long been focused on the peculiarities of Epaminondas’ deployment. Historians speculate about the reasons for Cleombrotus’ formation, with little-to-no notice paid to the fact that the battle was arguably lost before the Spartans took the field. The Spartans were plagued by exhausted allies without the will to fight, by scant numbers after decades of war—for a state that depends on its citizen soldiers—and by an outright disdain for cavalrymen. Sparta didn’t have the numbers, in the ways that mattered, to exploit the Theban gambit. Cleombrotus may have known this, if not at the start of the day then certainly by the end of it. His death at Leuctra could perhaps be called deliberate in a meaningful capacity—an honorable man who took the only estimable path left to him, at the conclusion of a century-long conflict. \n   \n\nEpaminondas for his part was a fine commander despite it being presently fashionable for historians to lionize his tactical gamble—but the idea that Epaminondas’ unorthodox formation was the single stroke of genius which unraveled the Spartan war machine remains unconvincing. Compared to the weight of decades of attrition, flawed doctrinal decisions, and the destructive flight of panicked Spartan cavalry, Epaminondas’ strategy was well-facilitated by the Spartans themselves. While no man is equal to his own legend, perhaps Epaminondas ought only to have the laurels for the battles he won, instead of being crowned victor in the ideological skirmishes between modern institutional academics."

  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/architectural-symbolism-of-the-scepter",
  "content": "Students of archaic architecture and her traditional symbols will certainly have encountered the notion of the microcosm. For most, it seems satisfactory enough to point out that the temple, in all its forms, is always intended to be emblematic of the world. At the same time there is a companion idea, common to a great many cultures, that the temple is a kind-of corpus or body; the body, as the Biblical saying goes, is a temple. And beyond, there are many traditions to be found which describe the body itself as a microcosmic model, much the same. Though many scholars are happy enough to repeat these associations in passing, in service often times of other goals, a thorough treatment that draws together all three ideas; which sheds a bit of holistic light on the reasoning for the superposition of body, temple, and cosmos itself, remains somewhat elusive.\n \n\nOf Porphyry’s description of the Mithraic microcosm; the cave of Zoroaster, Thomas Maurice explains:\n\n​\n\n“... the Mithraic caverns represented the world. According to Eubulus, Zoroaster first of all, among the neighboring mountains of Persia, consecrated a natural cell, adorned with flowers and watered with fountains, in honour of Mithra, the father of the universe. For he thought the cavern an emblem of the world fabricated by Mithra; and in this cave were many geographical symbols arranged with the most perfect symmetry and at certain distances, which shadowed out the elements and climates of the world.”\n\n​\n\nIn an altogether simple way, one may be given to wonder why it was that man of antiquity sought to build his temples in symbolic imitation of the apparent order of the cosmos at all. One may wonder as well how an esoteric understanding of the human body was related to that architectural objective. According to what rationale did the architects of history’s noblest cultures come to draw these same conclusions over, and over again? It remains the case that even the most complex cultural systems established for the architectural modeling of the cosmos must be arranged according to some metaphysical rationale, which, is altogether humane. That is, one which is derived according to a line of thinking that remains evident enough to those who took up the trade, that the persistence of this common, symbolic objective can be seen not as, itself, a doctrine, but rather, as the qualitative fountainhead of architectural doctrines. \n\n\nAt present we will limit the scope to the question of connecting the temple to the body. It seems upon careful consideration that the connection between temple and body is most essentially understood with a discussion of the esoteric symbolism of measurement. From measurement, then, proportion; and from proportion, on to some of the tools and symbols that defined the architect’s qualitative mentality. \n\n \n\n+\n\n\nMeasure\n\n​\n\nIn order to measure something, it must only be related to something else. All that is required for such a comparison to be made (or, that is, for a measurement to be taken) is that the thing being measured shares a quality in common, with the thing being used as a rule. In other words, we can say that to measure one thing is to express it in terms of something else. \n \n\nIn symbolic comparison, we are familiar with the Latin word, ‘ratio,’ but the Greeks named such a statement-of-measure λόγος (logos). Common types of measure—including length, mass, volume, or size—were called μέρος, (meros) or ‘magnitude.’ To the Greek sensibility, magnitude and number were distinguished from one another. The nature of that distinction may not be so immediately clear to the modern observer, and so, in order to properly understand the esoteric importance of concepts like number, proportion, measure—and therefrom, the symbolic character of architectural systems designed according to those concepts—we ought to begin by attempting to clarify this distinction in the Greek mind between a magnitude, and a number.\n\n\nTake, for example, two lines of arbitrary length—length being a shared quality between them. They can be compared in terms of their length. That they are equal or unequal might be observed, as well as which is longer and which is shorter. These are qualitative judgements, and are inherent to the form of the objects in question. More complex geometric operations can also be performed, which amount to the four basic functions of arithmetic, all entirely without number. Two magnitudes may be appended to produce a sum, one may be removed from another to yield a difference. Two linear magnitudes can be multiplied to form a plane the area of which is their product, and division—that is, the severance of equal components from a whole—can likewise be constructed geometrically, as division is only a form of measurement with a given unit.\n \n\nA λόγος, or ratio, does two things. It establishes what standard is to be applied as a measuring partition (called the consequent), and it establishes what it is that we intend to measure, or to express in terms of that standard (called the antecedent). That is the simple mystical operation underlying all proportion; the creation of terms of expression has long been a profound, and pervasive occult principle.\n\n\nThe Pythagoreans contended that only if whole, equal components of the antecedent can be measured by the consequent, does the ratio of magnitudes then constitute a number. In that case the given magnitudes are said to be commensurate or, co-measurable. Magnitudes which cannot be expressed as a number in this way are incommensurate. Though an incommensurate thing cannot be defined as a number, it can be expressed as a single, resultant magnitude. The thing exists, but cannot be put to strict language; it can only be demonstrated.\n\n\nWhile two magnitudes of different quality cannot be put to a meaningful ratio with one-another, the geometer Eudoxis described a theory of proportion that permitted the comparison of ratios themselves, because, commensurate ratios both constitute numbers (For example, a cone and a cylinder of the same base and height will stand in proportion such that the ratio between their volumes, and the ratio 1:3, are themselves equivalent). All of which is only to say this: Proportion is a constant relationship between ratios, no matter the quality. Proportion, then, as an esoteric concept must be understood to bely a divine governing language, through which, ancient observers were able to glimpse the metaphysical connections, rules, and laws that governed seemingly disparate things. \n\n \n\nMan of antiquity used his body as the standard of measurement for all things. The simplest cubit was defined as the magnitude from the elbow to the tip of the fingers. The Greeks observed of their body that four dactyls comprised the width of a palm. A foot was divided as well into dactyls. Larger units of measure were configured from these basic units; a stadion being six-hundred feet, and five-thousand being a mile. Of course there was somewhat little in the way of standardization. It was well known in Ancient Greece that—for example—athletes competing in a footrace in one place, may be running on a slightly longer track than another place, as a foot here was slightly longer than a foot there. Standardization of units themselves is not so important to the discussion of proportion.\n\n\nTo simplify a bit, we might say that because we are men the universe appears to us in terms of man. What it is that we see; what we can grasp through comparison or can measure by computation—those two quarreling twins of all mentality—is necessarily constrained to the terms in which we see. Therefore, the cosmos possesses a fundamentally anthropomorphic quality, because it is man who regards it and passes judgement upon it. Put another way, the hammer sees only a world of things to be struck. \n\n\nAnaxagoras  nodded to the radical, mystical importance of measurement in writing that “the purpose of life is the investigation of the Sun, Moon, and the Heavens.” Further refinement of his propensity for measurement appears, broadly, to be responsible for man’s civilized tendency away from conducting religious rites in wild nature, and toward the design of his own spaces; toward the temple. \n\n \n\n+\n\n\nProportion\n   \nIn the architectural schools today proportion is typically presented in passing, as an aesthetic novelty. It’s something almost frivolous, which is perpetrated upon the architecture according to the superstitious tastes of men who were yet-to-develop a more mature, industrious mentality. Proportion, to the academic, is a matter of antiquated taste, fashion, or style. \n \n\nThat beauty, in the Vitruvian sense of the word, is defined in terms of proportion is known to intellectuals; they are aware of it. The modern intellectual may realize that proportion was a thing of some importance to the ancients, yet, seldom is he able to furnish an explanation for how, or why, which resists materialistic reduction. Of proportion he sees only its mundane, aesthetic aspects. Those over-crude and secularized items, which simply look a certain way, are all that he means when he offers the word. For the intellectual, the word is only a category. Mistaking a manner of making with a manner of looking is perhaps one of the most garish symptoms of modernity.\n \n\nThat one ‘rule’ would be standardized is a materialistic necessity; it serves the tax collector, and the merchant. Conversely, consider that any human body—no matter its individual size relative to another—contains within itself the same rules as any other. That the body expresses certain proportional relationships, in terms of its own λόγος, is always the same. These rules are true, local to any human system. So we understand that a standardized rule is a mundane imposition upon the world, by man. λόγος, by contrast, is a divine formula that characterizes the natural world, and describes the relationships between its constituent parts. This, as well, we can note in passing, is the wellspring of the symbolic accord between the human body and the cosmos for the Ancients; the body is formed according to proportional laws in much the same way that the natural world expresses its own proportional laws. As Vitruvius says, \n\n​\n\n“…the human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the chin to the top of the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a tenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is just the same; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of the breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. … The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown.” \n\n​\n\nProportion, we will define as this: Correspondence between the magnitudes of individual parts of a work, and, the correspondence between the entire work and a certain part set out as the rule. Perhaps the most critical proportion evident in the human body, is the squared circle. Vitruvius, again, explains: \n\n​\n\n“Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centered at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.”\n\n​\n\nTo attenuate the language a bit, we may say that the body contains within itself a proportional relationship between the square and the circle. Any student of the Hermetic arts will no doubt understand the significance of this observation; that the central symbol of the alchemical opus—the transfiguration of the self; the union between two emblems long-offered to represent the earthly and celestial realms—is contained within, and expressed by the proportional configuration of the human body.\n\n\nHere we come, at some length, to consider the word itself. When the architects of Ancient Greece spoke or wrote about proportion, of course they did not use the Latin word ‘proportion,’ which was loaned much later into English and passed down to us presently. They used an older, Greek word; one which also still exists in modern English, though, one which for us has lost its architectural connotation: Analogy. \n\n\nElsewhere I have commented on the critical role played by philology for any serious esoteric inquiry. On account of shared relevance to the proceeding arguments, I will reproduce that brief passage here, now: ‘It’s hard to justify ignoring the structure of a word or of a name, especially when the object is to interrogate the esoteric intentions of an otherwise hidden subject. Such things are never arbitrary for the ancients, are often idiomatic the further back we can discern their roots, and are seldom categorical. Understanding the literal meaning of a word or a name is invaluable, then, because it reveals what things the ancients who employed those words used, to stand-in for the concepts or ideas they were naming. All are, to some degree, analogies.’\n   \n\nSo, to apprehend the Greek idea of proportion as it came to define that architectural tradition, we begin with the word itself. Recall that a ratio was known to the Greeks as ‘λόγος’ (logos). The word for what we call ‘proportion’ in architecture, was ‘ἀναλογία’ (analogia), to the Greeks. Formed by compounding two words, ’ἀνα’ and ‘λόγος,’ we can see even at a glance, that the standard of comparison in sacred geometry, the λόγος, forms the basis of the name the Greeks lent to the system of proportion that governed the temple: Ana-logos. \n   \n\nλόγος descends from the same Proto-Indo-European root as the Latin word ‘legio,’ which is where the modern English word ‘legion’ originates, but which literally meant ‘chosen’ in the Roman tongue; in the military context, something like ‘chosen warriors.’ The Proto-Indo-European root likewise most nearly corresponds to something like ‘to gather up,’ ‘to choose,’ or ‘to collect.’ Heraclitus was the first to apply λόγος as a philosophical principle—signifying those words which are ‘chosen,’ and arranged to physically convey meaning.\n   \n\n‘ἀνά’ (ana-) is typically translated to ‘up.’ However, ἀνά can also translate more nearly to something like the English prefix ‘re-’, as in reuse, remake, or regard. Therefore, ἀνά might be likened, in some cases more accurately, to ‘again.’ In the case of ἀναλογία, it is this second sense, from which I believe the word’s original, literal meaning was formed and lent to the matter of architectural proportion by the Greek masters. In the sense of measurement, ἀναλογία might thus be translated as ‘the standard, again,’ or more nearly, ‘[to take] the standard (λόγος), again.’ Therefore ἀναλογία refers to the process of deriving what-comes-after, given a rule, from what-comes-before. Viewed this way, ἀναλογία is a simple, and literal formation for the act of measurement. Further then—and this is the key—for the ancient architect, proportion by its very name would thus correspond to the reflexive quality of a thing which expresses by virtue of its form, the standard(s) which gives it form.\n   \n\nPerhaps not so well-known is the fact that the Greeks did not employ drawing in their architectural process, to any serious degree. They conducted their architecture in accordance with a canon. The canon was gathered upon a foundation of universal principles. The mechanism of that foundation was proportion. Given several parameters (λόγος), the temple was designed analogically, in-situ, throughout the construction process. Any given state of the system defined the subsequent states. That is what we mean, when we say that proportion is a mystical methodology, not a style; the aesthetic of the proportional method is, itself, incidental. \n   \n\nThe Greek architects did not draw largely because it would have been prohibitively difficult to laminate enough individual pieces of parchment, or papyrus, to form a writing surface sizable enough to work to any real degree of detail. Therefore it fell to proportional relationships to lend a measure of predictability to the complex and expensive processes of design, and construction. In order to ensure that the relation between constituent parts remained proportionate, the architect made use of several tools. The exact nature of these tools is not clearly known; we know their names, but not their specific function nor their particular form. \n   \n\nWe know that a verbal description of the structure’s dimension and general configuration was common. From that, which is typically called the ‘building account,’ enough was agreed upon between client and architect to begin construction according to the canon. Two tools, peculiar to the architects trade, were called ‘ἀναγραφεύς’ (anagrapheus) not to be confused with the Byzantine bureaucratic office of the same name, and ‘παραδειγμα’ (paradeigma), or paradigm. Broadly speaking, both seem to have been standards of a sort—against which individual components of the temple could be checked and refined by workers and tradesmen, on-site, during construction. A classical sculptor’s pointing-machine comes to mind, comparatively. It is for this reason that the compass, or calipers, are often depicted as the tools of the maker of the universe; the compass allows for a workman to transfer measurements from a divine standard onto a mundane system. They are what permit him to create his temple proportionate to, and therefore in the image of, the world.\n   \n\nBearing in mind the philosophical implications of proportion to the Greeks, then, consider the following passage from the fifth book of The Histories of Herodotus, where it is said that the architects were able to produce the Temple of Delphi to such a quality as to surpass the paradigm itself: \n\n​\n\n“After fortifying Lipsydrium north of Paeonia, they [the Athenians], in their desire to use all devices against the sons of Pisistratus, hired themselves to the Amphictyons for the building of the temple at Delphi which exists now but was not there yet then. Since they were wealthy and like their fathers men of reputation, they made the temple more beautiful than the model [παραδειγμα] showed. In particular, whereas they had agreed to build the temple of tufa, they made its front of Parian marble.”\n\n \n\n+\n\n\nScepter, and Wand\n\n​\n\nTo locate the scepter and wand symbols in this talk of measure and proportion, we turn our attention now briefly to the Egyptians. Egyptian geometers were able to determine perfect right angles through the use of a twelve-unit cord, according to a rather straightforward process. First the magnitude of a single unit was decided. Next, thirteen knots were tied along the cord so as to partition the length into twelve equal units. The geometer would then fix two foci (rods) at the points following the third, and following the seventh units. With the cord divided then, into lengths of three, four, and five, the leftmost (three) and rightmost (five) segments were rotated around the foci until they intersected at an inevitable point in space. The result is always a proportional triangle—which later came to be given the name of the Greek geometer Pythagoras—as well as a perfect right angle about the first focus. Longer ropes scaled in these proportions could be employed by surveyors on site to establish true axial relationships.\n\n \n\nThough not specifically related to the subject at-hand, it’s worth noting at this juncture that the zodiacal importance of the number twelve, and the kheiromantic relevance of the same celestial number represented in the fingers, suggests a deeply-rooted relationship between the symbolism of the hand—that is, its use in divination—and the holy tools of the architect. That discussion, however, is undertaken elsewhere.\n   \n\nThe very beginning of the construction process for any sacred structure was the alignment, measurement, and configuration of its foundations. Orienting the foundations was so critically important that the Egyptian architects ritualized the process and gave to it the name “the stretching of the cord.” Alignment to the major, heavenly axis was determined through the use of a sighting rod and careful observation of circumpolar stars. By staking out two lines from the sighting rod, toward the rising and setting of one such star (or several), the astronomer delineated an angle on-site. Bisecting that angle yielded a line of perfect accord to the axis of rotation of the great wheel; true north. From here followed on the major and minor axes of the structure.\n   \n\nThe harpedonaptai, as they were named, drew out their cords next, knotted in equal parts to ten units of the structure; ten royal cubits per portion (seven palms of four digits each), and plotted the four corners of the temple. According to this system, the foundation trenches were dug. In them the Pharaoh laid the cornerstones of the temple, and votive offerings were likewise deposited. The ancient sources tell us that the Pharaoh personally took part in the stretching of the cord; tradition holds that he did so together with the goddess Seshat—holding in his hand one rod, and she the other. With golden hammers they staked out the foundations of the microcosm, according to these sacred systems of measurement.\n   \n\nAll systems of measure, no matter how complex or primitive—and therefrom all systems of proportion—depend upon the designation of a unit. The unity is quite literally the establishment of the ‘one’ unit of measure, and with a set notion of what one entails, thereafter are determined subsequent valuations. The nature of two is defined in terms of one. Without a sense of what one unit is, it cannot be said that there are two of that thing, or three, and so on.\n   \n\nFor early architects the establishment of the unit was an act that permeated the entire structure of the temple, and defined its proportions. Providing the unit is a divining act. As a matter of fact, this line of rationale is very likely the source of the turn of phrase ‘divining,’ as a magical ascertainment. It is well-established, for example, that the intercolumniation (the distance between two columns in the peristyle) was the constraining unit for the Doric temple’s proportional systems, in archaic Greece.\n \n\nIn an esoteric context, it will perhaps now be evident why the act of setting out the unit should be understood as the first cause, which determines and effects the architectural construction. Symbolically, the suppliance of the royal cubit for the construction of the temple therefore is analogous to the cause-without-cause, predicating all of creation. Whereas the geometrical calculations that are conducted by making use of the unit are derived, or perhaps more appropriately determined—in the sense of term-making—given the unit as an axiom, the unity itself is a thing which is conjured up as the case from nothing. It’s not computable. The unit is given, by its nature, from the king according to his intention for the scale of the temple, in the same way that creation is set into its motions according to the impetus of the godhead.\n\n\nFor this reason do many myths the world over describe the creation of the mundane world in terms of a body part of the divine—the body first serving as the paradigm, or model for standards of measurement and exemplary proportions. As we will see in a later discussion, the  rationale that apparently links human sacrifice to architectural foundation rituals arises from this manner of thinking as well. The divine body supplies the primum movens for the world (an act which has a necessarily sexual dimension as well), and so too does the human body provide the cubit for the temple, to be made in the manner of the world.\n   \n\nSurveyors and architects have, since the farthest reaches of antiquity, carried in-hand rods of measure. Egyptian and Akkadian cubit rods are among the oldest that survive. Together with the cubit rod, the stake and the knotted cord (which are the true origin of the symbolic rod and ring) constitute the most ancient tools of measurement, and represent the most archaic form of the geometric mysteries. If one studies the iconography of the goddess Seshat, with whom the Pharaoh collaborated the temple foundation rituals, one will find that she carries with her an object that could confidently be interpreted as a staff of measure, and at its base is set the shen; the rod-and-ring emblem.\n   \n\nThe exact nature of the royal scepter is thus revealed to be a symbol of the divine will, in the form of the measuring rod. Wielding the scepter represents the king’s sovereignty, for the specific reason that it demonstrates his possession of the divine capacity, or right, to rule. The king’s divine mandate is analogous to the action of the godhead, which provides the prime movement for all of creation—the first cause. It’s not by chance that the English word ‘rule,’ which comes down to us from a distant Proto-Indo-European root, contains the triplicate meanings of measurement, of judgement, and of reign. Turns of phrase like “the rule of law” grow up from the very same analogical root, and even today, we continue to refer to the law itself as having a body, or corpus.\n   \n\nWith the scepter, then, serving in a rational way to symbolize sovereignty, unity, and rule, we can at last begin to form a proper understanding of the deeply held and archaic origins of the magic wand, as a symbol for divine creativity. Encapsulated in the wand are all the abilities of transmutation, transfiguration, and transposition; in a word: Creation. It becomes self-evident that both the scepter and the wand as symbols—of the divine provenance of the king, and of the magical arts, respectively—are descendants of the rod of rule. Both owe the Hermetic flowering of their emblematic legacy to the same mysterious architectural seed."

  "content": "Science has no marvels; every so-called discovery heralded as marvelous (for men of science understand the power of bold advertisement to the full as well as scientists in clog-dancing, in hair dressing, and tightrope walking), is not a marvel in the true meaning of the word.\n   \n\nThe Rontgen rays, the microphone, the phonograph, are all as simple in themselves as is the property of amber rubbed to take up straws. From the beginning there have been Rontgen rays, and the principles of the microphone and phonograph are coeval with the world. The wonder lies not in the discovery (so-called), but in the fact that they have remained so long unknown. The real mystery of mysteries is the mind of man. Why, with a pen or brush, one man sits down and makes a masterpiece, and yet another, with the selfsame instruments and opportunities turns out a daub or botch, is twenty times more curious than all the musings of the mystics, works of the Rosicrucians, or the mechanical contrivances which seem to-day so fine, and which our children will disdain as clumsy. The conquests of the mind never grow stale, let he who doubts it read a page of Plato and compare it with some a la mode philosopher. \n   \n\nI take it that one of the objects the author of this work is to sustain, that in astronomy, in mathematics, and in certain other branches of learning, the ancients knew a good deal more than modern men of science care to admit. \n   \n\nKnowledge to-day is not diffused, as writers in newspapers, makers of almanacks, members of school-boards, and worthy men who see the means but cannot grasp the fullness of achievement, are never tired of stating, but on the contrary, goes almost contraband. The fact that all can read and write, cypher and scan the columns of a newspaper, can tell the latitude (the longitude more rarely) of Jella Coffee, can prattle innocently of literature, art, spiritualism, and chemistry, can make their pertinent remarks upon theosophy, discuss religion, say a word in season on lithotomy, and generally conmport themselves as if their minds were fashioned after the pattern of a kaleidoscope, does not go far to prove the claim of wide extended knowledge.\n   \n\nWhen all write books and few have time to read, when thought grows rare and talking never ends, a serious book in which a man has put the labour of his life needs some apology for its appearance. Deal with sex problems (pruriently, of course), be mystical, moral, or immoral, flippant, or best of all be dull, success is sure. Still, in an age of symbolism, for everything we see is but a symbol, as kings, queens, dukes, lords, princes, barons, and sandwichmen, it must perforce be interesting to some to read of why the chief symbol of our present faith came to be held in veneration. \n   \n\nIn modern times we use a word, merely to express a thing, and only rarely concern ourselves with the exact value that the word may have. This may account to some extent for the loose style of many English writers, but to examine into that would be quite foreign to my purpose. Certain it is that in the ancient world, words and even letters all had their value apart from what we, now-a-days call meaning. Thus it is that oriental nations, and especially the Jews and Arabs, attach to their particular alphabets not merely a divine origin (for I suppose our alphabet is just as divine as theirs), but a particular sense of sanctity. No one supposes if a better alphabet than we now employ were to be found that we should still adhere from superstitious motives to our own. In the ancient world, apart from letters, every ceremony, each rite, and all the arts and sciences had some peculiar canon which was supposed to govern them. If, in his researches, the author has brought to light some canon which may enlighten architects, and so redeem us from the outrages that our builders heap upon us, if he can do even a little to stay the hands of Deans and Chapters from destroying buildings which, by the folly of a nation, have been committed to their care (like sheep to wolves), or put a stop to the restorer, that arch-fiend, who in consuming thirst for unity tears down a fine Renaissance door-way in a Gothic church, and puts up in its stead what he thinks is Gothic, his labour will not have been lost. Could he redeem us from Victorian Queen-Anne—but mitigate the horrors of plate-glass, set bounds to all the Gothics, ranging from Strangulated, through the degrees of Congregational and Convulsional down to Ebenezaresque, could he but find a style in which our builders could express their thoughts, and help them build for us, our churches, houses, theatres, and bridges, without adhering slavishly to bygone styles, the twelve shillings which I understand his volume is to cost will be well spent. \n   \n\nMusic and literature, with painting, surgery, and economics, with boxing, fencing, and others of the liberal arts, all have a style fit and peculiar to the times, but architecture yet remains a blot and a disgrace to those who live by it, and to all those who use the edifices which it makes, and pay the maker’s bills. \n   \n\nBut leaving architects bemired in stucco and happy in their “co-operation with the present system,” let us return to the folly of the ancients. … The writer of this work most plainly sets it forth, and, in so doing, connects conclusively our symbolism with that which seems inherent in mankind, and gently puts aside all our pretensions to the possession of a faith revealed to us alone. \n \n\nInto these mysteries I shrink from entering, but watch him boldly walk among the Canon Laws which govern Architecture, Music, Religion, and other things, the laws of which I take on trust. Unorthodox, even in his unorthodoxy, he is sufficiently un-English to be logical and not to shirk, after the English fashion, the just conclusions towards which his reasoning leads. ...\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe failure of all efforts in modern times to discover what constituted the ancient canon of the arts, has made this question one of the most hopeless puzzles which antiquity presents. It is discouraging in the extreme to approach the subject at all. The absence at all of explicit information from the ancients themselves, combined with the complete ignorance of modern authorities, is sufficient to make one hesitate to lay before the reader any proposition, however plausible, on this obscure subject. It is hoped, however, that the investigation of what appears to be a clue to the method practiced by the old architects in building the temples, may prove of some assistance in elucidating the principles, which were the common groundwork of the arts and sciences in the past. For it would appear, that there was an established canonical law underlying the practice of building as well as all other arts. \n \n\nIn a general way this has been felt by all competent students of antiquity; and many traces of such an uniformity have been pointed out, but as the root of everything in the old world was primarily centered in religion, it is to the ancient theology, that we must look for the foundation and basis of the old canon.\n\n\nThe priests were practically the masters of the old world. Everything and everybody was subservient to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and no work could be undertaken without its authority. That the priests were legitimately entitled to regulate the building of the temples of the gods, nobody will deny. And that they did exercise this control is beyond dispute. ...\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nIt is these secrets of the old priests, carefully guarded by them, and only communicated to the authorized builders of the temples that we propose to treat in the following pages, and we shall endeavor to show that these secrets, comprising the esoteric doctrine of religion, have been transmitted in unbroken continuity, at least from the building of the Great Pyramid, down to recent times. It is, of course, far beyond the scope of this small work, limited to a single object of inquiry, to enter into a historical examination of the evidences of this continuity of idea, and since there are already in existence books dealing with this special investigation, it is superfluous to undertake it. It is only necessary to accept the testimony of the old Greek historians, who emphatically assert, that the essential doctrines of the Greek religion were imported to Greece from Egypt. We know that all modern civilization in Europe is of Greek origin.\n   \n\nJust as Pythagoras and Plato, and other Greek philosophers visited Egypt to study the religion and sciences of that country, so every educated man of a subsequent age studied the religion and philosophy of Greece with the same object, namely, to perfect themselves in that knowledge, of which the Greeks were known to have been the recipients. To us the Egyptians are only a step further off; but fundamentally the doctrines which we are now investigating were the same both in Greece and Egypt. How much, the original religion and philosophy of the Egyptians may have been improved by filtering through the refinement of Greece, must be decided when Egyptologists come to have a deeper knowledge of Egyptian things, than they have at present. But whatever changes may have been added by Greeks and Christians to the original Egyptian theology, it is insisted, that the central mysteries were accepted by all priests and philosophers, as the only possible basis for religion. And more than that (for we must not always be content with a sensible reason for anything in human affairs) the absolute conservatism, always observed in religious matters, would scarcely admit that any received doctrine, once established, should be removed. ...\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe oldest use of numbers as symbols of an esoteric doctrine is to be found in Egypt, from whence it was derived by the Greeks, and transmitted by them to the modern world. Although we have, unfortunately, no direct evidence of how the mysterious people of Egypt actually made use of their numbers, it would appear that their numerical system formed a part of the dogma in those laws, referred to by Plato as having been ten thousand years old, and was perpetuated, as one of the bases of religion and art by all subsequent peoples. The words of Plato are:\n\n\n“Long ago they appeared to recognize the very principle of which we are now speaking—that their young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains of virtue. These they fixed, and exhibited patterns of them in their temples; and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to leave the traditional forms, or invent new ones. To this day no alteration is allowed, either in those arts or in music, at all. And you will find that their works of art are painted or moulded in the same forms that they had ten thousand tears ago (This is literally true, and no exaggeration), their ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than the work of to-day, but are made with just the same skill.” ...\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nTheology in its various forms, has always been the epitome of art, and constituted the law for its guidance. From the times of ancient Egypt this law has been a sacred arcanum, only communicated by symbols and parables, the making of which, in the ancient world, constituted the most important form of literary art; it therefore required for its exposition a priestly caste, trained in its use, and the guilds of initiated artists, which existed throughout the world till comparatively recent times, were instructed in it. Now-a-days, all this is changed. Theology has dropped her secrets; her symbols have become meaningless ornaments, and her parables are no longer understood. The artist in service of the Church no longer represents her mysteries in metaphorical shapes, and the priests have as little skill in the old art of myth-making, as they have in interpreting the Scriptures. \n   \n\nFew people have an adequate appreciation of this lost principle—the art, that is, of working symbolically. To us who have now nothing to conceal, such a practice has naturally gone out of fashion, and the symbol, as a means of concealing rather more than it was intended to explain, has become gradually obsolete. We still write or paint symbolically, but only to make that, which is obscure more plain. In the hands of the old priest, or artist, on the contrary, the symbol was a veil for concealment, beautiful or grotesque, as the case might be. A myth or parable, in their hands subtly conveyed a hidden truth, by means of a more or less obvious fiction; but it has come to pass, that the crude and childish lie on its surface is ignorantly believed for the whole truth, instead of being recognized, as the mere clue to its inner meaning. All theology is composed in this way, and her two-fold utterances must be read with a double mind. ...\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nWhen everything was mystical and metaphorical, it was only natural that numbers should have been brought to the service of Art. Geometry also provided a symbolic code, which may be someday understood. These geometrical symbols enabled the mathematicians to import the secret mysteries into their works and also gave to the builders a means of applying a numerical system to the temples, which as Plato says, exhibited the pattern of the laws in Egypt. ...\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nPhilosophy must have been equally dependent upon some system of geometry, for Plato wrote over the door of his academy \n\n​\n\n“LET NO ONE IGNORANT OF GEOMETRY ENTER HERE,” \n\n​\n\nand in the Republic, he says, “You must in the utmost possible manner direct the citizens of your beautiful city on no account to fail to apply themselves to geometry.” From this it may be concluded that Plato meant to inform us, that no one could understand his philosophy without knowledge of the geometrical basis of it, since geometry contained the fundamental secret of all the ancient science. ..."

  "content": "3 \nModern Realism\n\n​\n\nHow crude and shallow is the whole theory of modern realism: a theory of art by the average man for the average man! It makes art intelligible by simplifying or popularizing it; in short, as Nietzsche would say, by vulgarizing it. The average man perceives, for instance, that there is in great drama an element of representation. Come, he says, let us make the representation as “thorough” as possible! Let every detail of the original be reproduced! Let us have life as it is lived! And when he has accomplished this, when representation has become reproduction, he is very well pleased and thinks how far he has advanced beyond the poor Greeks. But it is hardly so! For the Greeks did not aim at the reproduction but at the interpretation of life, for which they would accept no symbol less noble than those ideal figures which move in the world of classical tragedy. To the Greeks, indeed, the world of art was precisely this world: not a paltry, sober and conscientious dexterity in the “catching” of the aspects of existence (nothing so easy!), but a symbolizing of the deepest questions and enigmas of life—a thing infinitely more noble, profound and subtle than realistic art. The Greeks would have demanded of realism, Why do you exist? What noble end is served by the reproduction of ordinary existence? Are you not simply superfluous—and vilely smelling at that? And realism could have given no reply, for the truth is that realism is superfluous. It is without a raison d’être.\n   \n\nThe average man, however, takes a second glance at classical tragedy and reaches a second discovery. There is something enigmatical, he finds, behind the Greek clearness of representation, something unexplained; in short, a problem. This problem, however, is not sufficiently clear. Let us state our problems clearly, he cries! Let us have problems which can be recognized at a glance by every one! Let us write a play about “the marriage question,” or bad-housing, or the Labour Party! But, again, the theory of the Greeks, at least before Euripides, was altogether different. The “problem” in their tragedies was precisely not a problem which could be stated in a syllogism or solved in a treatise: it was the eternal problem, and it was not stated to be “solved.”\n\n\nThus the Moderns, in their attempt to simplify art, to understand it or misunderstand it—what does it matter which word is used?—have succeeded in destroying it. The realistic and the “problem” drama alike are for the inartistic. The first is drama without a raison d’être, the second is a raison d’être without drama.\n\n​\n\n7 \nA Modern Problem\n\n​\n\nIt has been observed again and again that as societies—forms of production, of government, and so on—become more complex, the mastery of the individual over his destiny grows weaker. In other words, the more man subjugates “nature,” the more of a slave he becomes. The industrial system, for instance, which is the greatest modern example of man’s subjugation of nature, is at the same time the greatest modern example of man’s enslavement. What are we to think, then? Is the problem a moral one, and shall we say that a conquest of nature which is not preceded by a conquest of human nature is bound to be bad? In a society which has not surpassed the phase of slavery does every addition to man’s power over nature simply intensify the slavery? Or is the problem intellectual? And when the intellect concentrates upon one branch of knowledge to the neglect of the other, is the outcome bound to be the enslavement of the others? For instance the nineteenth century devoted far more of its brains to industry than to politics—its politics, indeed, was merely the reflection of its industry—with the result that industry has now enslaved us all. Yes, it has enslaved us all—not merely the wage-earners, not merely the salariat! In the old days the workman, indeed, was a slave, but now the employer is a slave as well.\n \n\nIn this age, therefore, in which man appears as the helpless appendage of a machine too mighty for him, it is natural that theories of Determinism should flourish. It is natural, also, that the will should become weak and discouraged, and, consequently, that the power of creation should languish. And so the world of art has withered and turned barren. The artist needs above all things a sense of power; it is out of the abundance of this sense that he creates. But confronted with modern society, that vast machine, and surrounded by its hopeless mechanics and slaves, he feels the sense dying within him; nor does the evil cease there, for along with the sense of power, power itself dies.\n   \n\nWell, does not the moral become clearer and clearer? If art and literature are to flourish again, artists, writers, nay, the whole community must regain the sense of power. Therefore, economic emancipation first!\n\n​\n\n19 \nThe Public\n\n​\n\n Of the modern writers who are in earnest, Mr. Chesterton has had the most ironical fate: he has been read by the people who will never agree with him. To the average man for whom he writes he is an intellectual made doubly inaccessible by his orthodoxy and his paradoxy. It is the advanced, his bête noire, who read him, admire him, and—disagree with him.\n\n​\n\n22 \nMiddle Age’s Betrayals\n\n​\n\n It is not easy to tell by a glance what is the character of a young man; his soul has not yet etched itself clearly enough upon his body. But one may read a middle-aged man’s soul with perfect ease; and not only his soul but his history. For when a man has passed five-and-forty, he looks—not what he is, perhaps—but certainly what he has been. If he has been invariably respectable, he is now the very picture of respectability. If he has been a man about town or a secret toper, the fact is blazoned so clearly on his face that even a child can read it. If he has studied, his very walk, to use a phrase of Nietzsche’s, is learned. As for the poet, we know how terribly poetical he looks in middle age—poor devil! Well, to every one of you, I say, Beware!\n\n​\n\n26 \nArt in Industry\n\n​\n\nIn those wildernesses of dirt, ugliness and obscenity, our industrial towns, there are usually art galleries, where the daintiest and most beautiful things, the flowers of Greek statuary, for instance, bloom among the grime like a band of gods imprisoned in a slum. The spectacle of art in such surroundings sometimes strikes us as being at once ludicrous and pathetic, like something delicate and lovely sprawling in the gutter, or an angel with a dirty face.\n\n​\n\n40\nAgain\n\n​\n\nSociety is a conspiracy, said Emerson, against the great man. And to blast him utterly in the centre of his being, it invented Original Sin. Is Original Sin, then, a theological dogma or a political device?\n\n​\n\n42 \nIf Men Were Equal\n\n​\n\nIf men had been equal at the beginning, they would never have risen above the savage. For in absolute equality even the concept of greatness could not have come into being. Inequality is the source of all advancement.\n\n​\n\n54 \nAgainst the Ostentatiously Humble\n\n​\n\nHe who is truly humble conceals even his humility. \n\n​\n\n65 \nWhither?\n\n​\n\nThe fever of modern thought which burns in our veins, and from which we refuse to escape by reactionary backdoors—Christianity and the like—is not without its distinction: it is an “honourable sickness,” to use the phrase of Nietzsche. I speak of those who sincerely strive to seek an issue from this fever; to pass through it into a new health. Of the others to whom fever is the condition of existence, who make a profession of their maladies, the valetudinarians of the spirit, the dabblers in quack soul-remedies for their own sake, it is impossible to speak without disdain. Our duty is to exterminate them, by ridicule or any other means found effectual. But we are ourselves already too grievously harassed; we are caught in the whirlwind of modern thought, which contains as much dust as wind. We see outside our field of conflict a region of Christian calm, but never, never, never can we return there, for our instincts as well as our intellect are averse to it. The problem must have a different solution. And what, indeed, is the problem? To some of us it is still that of emancipation—that which confronted Goethe, Ibsen, Nietzsche, and the other great spirits of last century. It is an error to think that these men have yet been refuted or even understood; they have simply been buried beneath the corpses of later writers. And it is the worst intellectual weakness, and, therefore, crime, of our age that ideas are no longer disproved, but simply superseded by newer ideas. The latest is the true, and Time refutes everything! That is our modern superstition. We have still, then, to go back—or, rather, forward—to Goethe, Ibsen and Nietzsche. Our problem is still that of clearing a domain of freedom around us, of enlarging our field of choice, and so making destiny itself more spacious; and, then, having delivered ourselves from prejudice and superstition—and how many other things!—of setting an aim before us for the unflinching pursuit of which we make ourselves responsible.\n   \n\nGreater freedom, and therefore greater responsibility, above all greater aims, an enlargement of life, not a whittling of it down to Christian standards—that is our problem still!\n\n​\n\n122 \nApropos the Cynic\n\n​\n\nHe wrote with an assumption of extreme heartlessness, and the public said, “How tender his heart must be when he hides it under such a disguise!” But what he was hiding all the time was his lack of heart.\n\n​\n\n187 \nLife as Expression\n\n​\n\nSchopenhauer interpreted life as the expression of a Will to Live. Nietzsche showed with profound truth that beneath this will there was something more fundamental, the Will to Power. Have we here got to the foundation, or shall we find that underlying the Will to Power there is something more fundamental still? Why do all living things strive for power? Is it, indeed, power that they desire in their striving, power for the sake of power? That which everything by a law of its being searches for is expression: the Will to Power is merely an outcome of that search. For seeing that the sum of created Life is split up into individuals, related and yet diverse, the expression of one unit is bound to collide with that of another, and the outcome is a conflict. Life, therefore, is essentially something that injures itself, and injures itself the more the more powerful it is; in a word, Life is essentially tragic. Most people, however, live in illusion, knowing nothing of this. The philosophers, and, before them, the priests, were those who perceived that Life was of this nature; but, alas, from the truth they drew the immediate and not the more profound conclusion. They sought, unconscious Hedonists, a palliative for Life, and contemned expression, which they saw was the cause of suffering. These were the creators of that morality which has prevailed to our own day; a morality antagonistic to Life, anti-tragic, negative. All the systems which have been created in this way are colossal panaceas and remedies: they are not fundamental.\n   \n\nThere were others, however, who saw as the priests did that Life was tragic, but who at the same time affirmed it. These were the tragic poets. They were more deeply versed in Life than the priests: tragic art is more profound than morality. For morality is based on the belief that man desires above everything else Happiness. But Tragedy has perceived that this is not so. Man will express himself, it proclaims, whatever the outcome, whether it be joy or suffering.\n   \n\nSince then morality has sunk deep into Life, and there is now almost a second instinct in man striving against expression. Consequently there are many existences passed without expression; sometimes even in a resolute struggle against it, as in the case of innumerable religious men and ascetics. To some men it seems that their spirit has been lying frozen and dead within them, until one day an influence touches them, and they feel an imperious desire to express themselves, to create. This influence is nothing else than Love, which is the desire for expression itself. When its rule is recognized and obeyed Life reaches its highest degree of joy and of pain, and becomes creative. This is the state which is glorified by the tragic poets. To those who affirm, it is the highest condition of Life."

  "content": "The Problems\n\n​\n\nWe might think of a tool as any external object with which a man can either extend his natural limitations, or improve upon his natural effectiveness. In a primitive sense a tool is a thing that makes him super-human. A weapon, then, is a tool for rendering another man unable to fight. Naturally, over the course of some millennia of war we have devised a number of ways to complicate the matter, and for the purposes of this essay I will set projectile weapons somewhat to the side. Launching something unpleasant toward an adversary, while requiring a certain skill all of its own, has long been considered as lacking the personal weight and direct interplay of close-quarters confrontation. Considerable effort has likewise been put into the art of making a man dangerous with his bare hands, but, the warrior who seeks an edge in combat is often the victor; it was not by stint of boxing that the cave bear came to be extinct.\n   \n\nThere is an abundance of close range weapons, and variants of them the world-over, but nearly all can be fit into only a few familiar categories. While the lines between categories can be, at times, indistinct—for reasons that will become clearer—those categories can generally be reckoned as follows: Axes, clubs, swords, spears and polearms. Each of these categories seeks to extend some capacity in which a man is wanting, or to hybridize several in attempt to broaden his utility. However as we will see, chasing utility also means a certain amount of generality, which becomes difficult and restrictive as a result of trying to balance too many conflicting fortés.\n   \n\nTo best understand the way these questions have been approached through the ages, we ought to first understand which specific capacities—or problems—in himself man sought to solve with weaponry. Three primary are problems are material, leverage and reach.\n   \n\nFor the problem of material, attacking flesh-and-bone with flesh-and-bone makes it difficult to ensure that only the foe receives the injury. Better to utilize an altogether sturdier material, which will more dependably inflict harm on your opponent, or on his equipment, while sparing you and yours. \n   \n\nWith the question of material open we can see, as well, that certain manners of striking—which would otherwise be impossible—become feasible. Namely: The cut and the thrust; each of which can more cleanly incapacitate the opponent’s animating anatomy, than could a concussive blow from a fist. While concussion, as well, is improved by sturdier material in the manner of crushing, concussive force is more directly improved through leverage.\n   \n\nIn the same way a closed fist swung at the end of an arm concentrates the force of the muscles at the hand, a lever—such as a club—can greatly increase the force delivered by extending the length of the arm, out from the fulcrum of the shoulder. Avoiding a long and unnecessary diversion into the elementary physics at play, it should suffice to summarize leverage as a mechanical means to increase the amount of force a man can deliver onto his target.\n   \n\nClosely related is the more straightforward matter of reach—of being able to reach out and touch a man, without him being able to do the same. Superior reach often proves a decisive advantage alone; ask any boxer who has faced an opponent of much greater stature. Thus far, and in these simple terms, we can begin to imagine the so-called perfect weapon. Forged of a material harder than flesh and bone, made with a profile which can cut, pierce and bludgeon, and of great length so as to maximize leverage and reach.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n\n​Weight, and Velocity\n\n​\n\nAs always however, the matter is somewhat more complicated. Firstly, those materials we have which can be made sharp are often brittle—or else do not long hold an edge. It’s likely that our earliest tools of war were either of wood, flint, or some combination of those basic elements. While a wooden club can in-fact be made to cut—as observed in some Polynesian variations—and flint can be given a razor edge, they are outclassed in durability by even the most rudimentary metals: Bronze, iron, and later, steel.\n   \n\nFor a weapon-smith, generally speaking, the critical question is that of the balance between hardness and elasticity. A harder blade will hone to a keener edge, and keep it longer, but it will also be more brittle and fragile. A more elastic blade will better manage the recumbent forces of impact with an opponent, but it will not hone as sharply or keep its edge for very long.\n   \n\nAdditionally, there is the matter of the weight of the material, due to the physical relationship between weight and velocity. Taking into account that a man can only swing so heavy a weight, and that a greater weight will result in a greater impact, why should a man not swing the heaviest weapon he can manage? The answer comes in the form of calculating the equation that describes impact force. Velocity is a much more significant multiplier of force than weight. Thus, it seems a man is perhaps best served by the weapon he can accelerate the fastest, rather than the heaviest one he can lift.\n   \n\nThe question then invariably becomes whether or not a warrior ought wield the lightest weapon. Such a weapon has its own troubles. On the very-light side of the scale, a weapon might begin to deform as a result of air resistance and, by fluttering, become undependable and difficult to swing true. A very light weapon will also necessarily lack certain structural considerations, which make it difficult for the weapon to perform the full breadth of service required of it; the light weapon may break on delivery of a strike, or in attempting to deflect one. The issue of leverage, too, begins to cut the other way as we consider the weapon’s heft. \n   \n\nA given weight held in the hand will be easier to lift, than it would be if the exact same weight was fixed to the end of a rod. This unwieldiness increases with length, and so is directly opposed to reach. Due to the momentum of a strike, the greater the weight (or effective weight, as we just outlined), the more difficulty there is in changing the direction of a weapon after a blow—to better interpose it between you and the movements of your enemy. These problems are made more manageable by crafting the weapon to be wielded with both hands, which allows you to turn the weapon about a point along its length by pushing with one hand while pulling with the other.\n   \n\nIt should be clear by this point that any weapon which maximizes one element of use will compromise another. Further, we can see that with a given task, a hybrid will not be able to compete with something more directed to that specific purpose. Let’s revisit the martial archetypes outlined at the beginning and see how they relate to one specialization, or another.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nSpecific Typologies\n\n​\n\nAn axe is a haft or handle—usually wood—mounted with a curved, cutting blade at one end and gripped at the other. The axe, as a tool, is designed to maximize leverage and cutting potential at the cost of a reduced ability to thrust, to recover, and to defend. Because the axe is not always designed for war; it’s most commonly a wood-cutting tool—it’s not necessarily designed with recovery following a strike, in-mind. However a war axe is often formulated to be used with one hand, which allows for the use of a shield, and which, in-turn can make up some defensibility. Slow recovery after a swing or parry makes it difficult to block, and blocking with the haft of an axe will inevitably damage the weapon, as metal hafts are prohibitively massive.\n   \n\nRather than prioritizing a cut, the club, hammer, or mace focuses on leveraging the blunt weight of metal into a concussive blow. To clarify the difference: A cut is achieved by separating a material through splitting its components. A blade does this by means of a wedge; its angled sides and narrow edge apply compression and shearing forces to either overcome the tensile strength of a material, or to fracture a brittle material along its imperfections. Severance is accomplished by concentrating all the force of the blow to the smallest possible area in order to drive the target apart at the blade.\n   \n\nThis is all well-and-good until one wonders after the reason for the exaggerated width and breadth of the blade of an axe. In order to explain these qualities, we must consider the forces which are incumbent back onto the blade itself. The width and angle of the wedge is determined by the hardiness of the material it’s intended to cut; more resistance requires a wider and sturdier wedge. The most narrow blades (in section) are best suited to only the softest materials. A flensing knife, for example, is thin in breadth and in section because it is meant to flex and bend; cutting meat around the bone. By contrast, a battle axe—with its wide wedge and deep breadth—is designed to cut through flesh, bone, and some lighter armors. \n   \n\nA concussive blow is about delivering force through the target by impact, rather than driving itself through the target. In this way, a hammer blow can shatter bones without having to break the skin or penetrate chain mail. The hammer can likewise cause a concussive brain injury without penetrating a plate helm. Therefore many clubs and hammers are formed without the concern of needing to concentrate force, with any real degree of precision. However, their heft means clubs face even more exaggerated problems of recovery, than do axes. As a result most variants are designed for use with one hand, though again, there are notable exceptions to this rule.\n   \n\nIt’s worth noting that the profile of either the hammer or the axe—a mass at the end of a lever—can allow for a greater utility-of-reach, in the form of hooking an opponents limbs, armaments, or defenses. Thereby, both are able to extend the range at which a man might grapple his opponent, or deliver a blow. Hammers and axes intended for use as weapons are often mounted with a spike, which delivers force in much the same way as a thrust—in terms of manifested damage—but by stint of needing to be swung, it will lack some virtues of the idealized thrust.\n   \n\nThe defining implement of the thrust is the spear, or lance, and is composed of a piercing point at the end of a long haft. A spear maximizes reach and delivers deep puncturing wounds, and while the point can be made very nimble and mobile, it can become unwieldy once an opponent is inside its reach. This vulnerability renders the spear primarily offensive, keeping opponents at bay by threat of attack, at the expense of the ability to parry or block blows—though it can be done in dire straits.\n   \n\nA piercing blow is similar to a cutting one, in that its aim to deliver the force of a blow as narrowly as possible. The difference being, that where the ideal cut is delivered along a line to split material, a thrust is delivered at a single point, and aims to penetrate a material as deeply as possible. Through concentrating the force into a smaller area, the spear puts a maximum of pressure on a minimum of resisting material in order to cause rupture. A narrow implement, such as needle, boasts a minute point but it is fragile. A point needs to be as narrow as possible to maximize concentration of force, but must also be strong enough not to bend or shatter under the force of the blow itself. Some spears have wider leaf blades that can cut as well as pierce, just as many axes will taper the top edge of their blade to a thrusting point, but both are limited in terms of the feasible depth-of-penetration. It’s quite difficult to run an axe all the way through an arm, or lop off a limb with a spear.\n   \n\nThe last particular virtue of the thrust is its directness. To swing with power from the shoulder, or even from the wrist, a blow with a swinging weapon requires some wind-up. It must approach the target along the curve of its trajectory. A pragmatic thrust, heeding Pythagoras, arrives in a straight line—and so is generally faster than a swing, all other considerations being equal. Additionally, with clever placement of a piercing weapon, one might allow his opponent’s momentum to carry out all needful movement and thereby impale himself.\n   \n\nAll of the variants of weapons discussed so far can be adapted to deliver force differently, according to need, or to better account for its disadvantages. In so-doing however, one weapon-type begins to step somewhat into the wheelhouse of another weapon type—all according to the specific problems posed by the opponent. Realistically, there will be some questions as to availability, preference, and prior experience involved as well. Because each of these tools is particularly specialized they are often shorn up by other equipment. As axes, clubs, and spears perform best offensively, they are frequently used in tandem with a shield, or with the added defensive benefits of armor. Or best of all, with the friendly fellow next to you. Of course situations often change, and circumstances which called for a spear or which shattered one, lead to the want for more versatile weapons.\n   \n\nThe sword, then is the answer. And while often wielded as the primary implement of fighting, under many circumstances it was also the preeminent sidearm—not necessarily because it was of secondary capability. Rather, it can meet and overcome a wider variety challenges which a more specialized weapon might not. Additionally, a sword is a much more successfully defensive weapon in guarding, and in parrying than is any other type—and so it follows that the sword traditionally fills the role of an item of resort. The sword is able to cut, thrust and guard, as well as achieve a better reach-to-weight ratio than an axe or club. However, the sword itself becomes a microcosm of the concerns we’ve already discussed, balancing specialization in reach, thrust, cut, and guard with its own profiles and configurations to maximize each.\n\n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Sword  \n\n​\n\nA sword, unlike its predecessors, demands metalwork. Some cutting clubs absent metal, like a maquahuitl or leiomano, may approximate a sword in some respects, but not so closely as to be called one. The sword, then, can be characterized as a narrow length of metal sharpened on at least one side, and fashioned with a grip or hilt at one end for the hand. The size and shape of a sword varies widely depending the problems it’s meant to solve, though all but the most specialized can do a bit of everything well-enough. As an aside, many of the principles that govern the shape of a sword can also be applied in miniature to the shape of a knife.\n   \n\nAll swords feature enhanced maneuverability, by placing the balance of the weapon closer to the hand. This is important for recovery after a swing, allowing for quick changes of the direction of attack. Weapons with more momentum at their tip require more effort, and more time to redirect. Or else, such a weapon swings in more predictable patterns in effort to maintain that momentum.\n   \n\nA sword, especially a lighter one, can move more dynamically—akin the tip of a spear. However, as a much greater percentage of its length is the “business end,” it’s more difficult to compromise the effectiveness of a sword by closing. This feature works in-tandem with a sword’s recoverability to make defensive options, like quick parries, deflections, or blocks, more reasonable. Nearly all swords feature some tricks to manage their weight, both to maintain their recoverability and as a result of the velocity problem. The most common, is the manner in which the edge is ground. In section, the sharper, more brittle steel is located at the tip of the wide angle, but squares off with thicker, elastic steel along the spine (or center) of the blade. This, in lieu of the more brittle material carrying the full weight of the entire wedge. Another common trick of the trade is some manner of fuller; sometimes erroneously called a ‘blood groove.’ In reality the fuller serves to remove excess material and weight from an area where the blade doesn’t require it. This often actually improves the structural performance of the blade by introducing opposed arches in the blade’s profile, which any architect can attest is a particularly desirable shape for handling excessive forces.  \n   \n\nAs for manners by which swords make themselves unique, we may first consider the benefits of a curving blade. The curved profile is most commonly seen in swords optimized to cut and slice, and its benefit is twofold. First, consider the weight distribution of our first cutting implement, the axe. The cutting edge is out ahead of the wrist, and the weight moves in the direction it’s meant to be swung. An axe balanced straight up on its haft will fall blade-first. Imagine how awkward the axe would feel in the hand, swung backward. This is because when held rightly, its momentum is naturally added to the swing; whereas if held backward, one has to fight the weight trying to fall backward for the entire swing.\n   \n\nThe second benefit offered by the curve is the way it assists the concentration force, for a cutting blow. A curved edge will meet its target at a steeper angle than will a straight one, applying less edge to the target with the same force—and so the same total force is applied to a smaller total area. This action can be assisted, if the center of a sword’s balance rests nearer the tip. Next, because it meets at an angle, a curved sword which is as wide as a straight one, will behave as though it’s wider because the line is being drawn diagonally across the blade, rather than straight across. This serves to both keep the swing true and ensure a deeper gash.\n   \n\nThere is also a particular matter, which is quite near to the hearts of many swordsmen; a physical phenomenon called the “center of percussion.” To again dodge an extensive foray into the physics of pendulums, the center of percussion on a sword is the point at which it delivers all the energy of blow, wasting none in vibration, and thereby maximizing itself as a lever. Generally, the center of percussion is larger in heavier, curved swords—making it easier to strike “the perfect blow.” It is worth noting that the advantages of a curved blade generally apply whether the point curves toward, or away from the edge.\n   \n\nAs we have learned, these advantages cannot be without cost; the price in this instance is the thrust. Most curved swords still taper to a point which can pierce, but because of the curve, the thrust must be impelled with considerably more force, as the side-on nature of the curve is now working against it. A piercing thrust will need to widen to the depth of the curve of the sword if it can actually be delivered with that much force. While not impossible from horseback, such a scenario is untenable on foot. The alternative is delivering the thrust along the angle of the curve, rather than in a straight line, which is effective, but lacks the directness and speed of a straight line—and sacrifices the reach of an arm out-thrust in favor of one bent at the elbow, to make the curve.\n   \n\nA thrusting sword, then, will want to be thin and straight, to maximize its piercing action. Highly specialized thrusting swords might reduce their cutting edges to near uselessness in favor of providing more conical support for the point, as with a misericord or estoc, both of which condense the necessary structural material in three dimensions behind the point. This type of sword is naturally nimble and plenty-sturdy in the parry, but is more limited in form of attack. Other swords, like some forms of rapier and jian can be formulated to prioritize the thrust, but still maintain a profile in-section and breadth of edge, which is viable in the slash. It’s worth noting here that it’s difficult to sharpen both sides of a curved sword. They are often better served by a wedge profile that allows a thick back, and so most examples of dual edged swords are straight.\n   \n\nI will not mire myself in the question as to whether or not one form of attack is somehow superior to another. Most patterns of sword share this attitude, and make some compromises in the ideal cut or thrust, in order to manage both well-enough for the variety of situations in which they will be used. Some straight, dual edged swords will be weightier in construction, wider at the base to create a larger center of percussion, and sport a deeper breadth to help the slash. The smith balances these considerations by introducing a steeply narrowing form, to a needle-fine thrusting point. Other single edged swords will curve only slightly, taking some advantage therefrom, while still maintaining a relatively straight thrust angle. Some advantages of shape can be made up in technique, as I have described for a curving thrust, or, by making a circular cut to create a cutting angle with a straight sword. It is better, however, to leave one’s mind free to consider other aspects of confrontation. One who is experienced enough to bear all this in mind could then, at a glance, evaluate the talents of a sword by its look and feel in the hand.\n   \n\nI will at last mention the polearm typology, which offers any variant of weapon so far discussed, maximized for reach, by affixing it to the end of a shaft. Thus, it a can offer the same virtues and vices—but with the added advantage of range at the cost of unwieldy recovery, and therefore is vulnerable to opponents who can close inside of its reach. It can usefully hybridize many formations in a manner different than a sword, but with much lower utility in guard. It could be said that the polearm is hybridized for more direct offense, whereas swords are hybridized defensively, but when wielded in-formation it often proves difficult to overcome their overlapping offensive arcs. In this way, a man can be his mate’s defense with his offense, a case which is true of any weapon, but which is exaggerated in the polearm.\n   \n\nThus, a man finds himself in an armory with the eternal question of what to take with him to war. As a rule, it is harder to cut armor than pierce it, but easier in the fray to deliver devastating slashes than thrusts to soft targets. He may know what ground he will hold, or if he will fight from the back of a horse, and choose a weapon which will help him apply force from above or direct it from his mount. If a man expects to be confronted with heavy shields or horses, he might select a weapon able to deliver much greater leverage that he can swing with both hands—be it sword, axe or hammer—especially if he can depend on armor to protect him. He may expect to fight in formation and have allies to assail an enemy inside his reach, and thereby choose a spear or polearm. \n   \n\nThe idea of a “perfect weapon” fades from the mind as one comes to understand all the variation of arms, not as flights of fancy or stylization, but as solutions to particular problems. The finest warriors, then, will either select the best tool for the task, or understand the ways in which shortcomings will need to be made up with technique, terrain, or manner of engagement."

  "content": "A Brief Apology\n\n​\n\nMost any surviving source, ancient or medieval, that deals with the practice of divination by regard of the lineaments of the hand is given to associate the forefinger with both the liver, and with Jupiter. In the entire body of serious kheiromantic writing practitioners and scholars have—for centuries—been content simply to repeat this set of associations for fact. Unfortunately even for the late-Renaissance mystics from whom the bulk of that writing comes, the forefinger’s linkage to Jupiter and to the liver is something that can only be stated, but scarcely explained. \n   \n\nManly P. Hall wrote, in his 1950 volume on the history of the ancient healing arts, “It is well to remember that all myths yield readily to reasonable interpretation.” Our task is just such a reasonable interpretation. One who is keen to delve into the sea of related symbols that form the forefinger-liver-Jupiter triad, will quickly come to understand that a careful study of language is absolutely necessary. Therefore the inquiry at-hand, into the fundamental aspects of kheiromancy and its apparent Proto-Indo-European source, will rely at times on assessing issues of comparative etymology. While that sort of study can prove a bit arcane for the lay-reader, however, one is encouraged to physically sound out the related words put forth in these arguments, and perhaps may be surprised at the ease with which the ear is able to recognize that, which at first glance confuses the eye.\n \n\nWith some apology made, then, for the occasional density of etymological theorizing, it’s prudent to begin by simply questioning how man of antiquity viewed the liver functionally, and symbolically. That will provide us the ground on which to pursue the liver’s connection to Jupiter, or the sky-deities, and eventually cross onto the wider plain of Proto-Indo-European healing arts, and the forefinger. \n\n​\n\n+\n\n\nLiver and Fire\n\n​\n\nAncient doctrine typically identifies the liver with the seat of life in the body. The liver was believed by ancient man to house his in-dwelling fire; his anima, or his soul. Scholars have supplied the term “hepatocentric,” or ‘liver-centered’ to traditions of that sort, in order to contrast them with belief systems that located the soul in the heart, or the head. Hepatocentrism may seem strange to the modern eye at a glance, but the symbolic rationale is straightforward enough. Observation of the human anatomy, even in a rudimentary way, reveals the liver to be a comparatively large organ, and crucially, to be one thoroughly saturated with blood. It follows that the liver is the source of blood in the body. The Anglo-Saxon leech book authored by Bald confirms this line of thinking for the medieval Germanics. In the second book, or Epitome, Bald describes the liver as a crucible which magically transmutes food into blood:\n\n \n\n“The liver is the peculiar seat of blood and its increase. … The liver accepts the most foul parts from food and cooking them with its heat, liquefies them at length. From this it makes blood, which first it collects with many pipes, then taken up it is led to four major blood vessels which are tied to the liver with a reservoir.”\n\n​\n\nA similar idea is represented quite clearly for the Greeks in the Promethean myth. Initially, Prometheus hides the best parts of the sacrificial ox from Zeus, which includes the liver. In doing so, Prometheus arguably steals the ‘inner-fire’ of the offering away from Zeus. His punishment is the continual consumption of his own liver by the eagles of Zeus; the suffering of continual death. Even at the time the Promethean myth is recorded by Hesiod, these analogies between the sky-god, the liver, and the life-giving warmth of blood seem well formed.\n \n\nThe general hepatocentric notion is thus clarified: The liver is viewed as a kind of furnace, which produces and warms the blood by its mystical soul-fire. The blood is then carried throughout the body from that spring or reservoir, and by warming the rest of the body, animates it. If that idea is indeed a Proto-Indo-European one, we would expect to find some elementary overlap between the ideas of blood, life, and warmth in that originating language. In fact, we do. \n   \n\nThe word ‘blood’ descends from martial expressions in the Proto-Indo-European, but the Latin for blood sanguinus has two roots in that tongue. The first is *h₁ésh₂r̥. This word meant ‘life-giving,’ and specifically signified patrilineal kinship. The second is krewh₂, which is the root for the later Greek κρύος (xhruos) “cold”, as well as the Latin crusta, “crust,” or “hard”. Cruelty, crushing, and hrae, “corpse,” or “carcass,” descend as well from this second Proto-Indo-European notion of a lack of warmth.\n   \n\nTo simplify, those Pontic-Caspian peoples appear to have distinguished idiomatically between two different types of blood: The “blood-inside” the body, and the “blood-outside.” Blood inside the body is an ancestor of words for bestowing life, and for kinship traced specifically through the father. Blood outside the body gives rise to words for cooling, coldness, hardness or coagulation, and the inanimate corpse. \n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nIchor and Water\n\n​\n\nCommon turns of phrase like a weak-liver, or a pale liver; ‘lily-livered’ are all descriptions of poor constitution, bad health, or a general weakness with the inner-fire. As it happens, liver, lieber, and life are all cognates. The Latin word for the liver was iecur, and its root, *hyḗkʷ-r̥, is thought by scholars to refer to the liver as well. One will note the unmistakable phonetic similarity between *hyḗkʷ-r̥ and the Greek term for the divine substance that flowed through the veins of the gods in place of blood; ἰχώρ (ixor) “ichor”. The etymology of ixor is, however, considered unknown by contemporary academic consensus. *hyḗkʷ-r̥ is also the root of the term “hepatic,” or the Greek ἧπαρ (ipar), which signifies the liver. It does seem tenable that ichor would come out of the same confluence of related terms for the liver, for blood, and for life—being the divine counterpart for blood. \n   \n\nAristotle, among others, echoes what seems to be a very ancient line of thinking—connecting water with the divine blood of the gods, only later to acquire the oft-repeated characteristics of honey and nectar. He writes that the cicada was thought to be immortal like the gods, because it had no blood and instead subsisted on dew. Countless mythological traditions pertaining to the ‘divine water’ stand now just outside the door, but before we pass through, we ought to take a moment to recognize a linguistic relation between water and the liver. As we will see, the connection between blood and ichor for the ancients appears to descend from a shared watery quality, and a warming quality, both generally associated with vitality.\n   \n\nWater has its Proto-Indo-European root in wódr̥, or *wed, which translates directly to “wet,” and does not interact with phonemes that we associate with blood, or the liver. It’s considered active rather than passive, in the same way that “ignite” is active, but “fire” is passive. However, fascinatingly, there is a passive counterpart-root for water as well, that more nearly means a body of water; a reservoir of water, or a river. This root has produced dozens of words with synonymous meanings in descendant languages. The word is h₂ep-, and the similarity between this phoneme and the liver-related prefix in “hepatic” or “hep-“ or the Greek ipar is quite striking. \n   \n\nAll of which is to suggest: A symbolic convergence, preserved in the language, between the liver, blood, water, and ichor. Its origin is a general idea that vitality is a function of warmth and wateriness, as opposed to the cold, inert dryness that consumes the body after the soul has departed. At the very least the postulate should be advanced that the word “ichor,” which has no yet-accepted etymology, is in fact clearly descended from, and cognate with, the root *hyḗkʷ-r̥ and it’s related form yókʷr̥. If that should prove to be true, “ichor” then shares its root with the Latin and the Greek words for the liver: Iecur, and ipar. \n   \n\nAnd so we come to understand a kind of far-ancient, qualitative wateriness lies at the root both the immortal blood of the gods, and the mortal blood of men. From there, hepatocentrism does not lay far downstream at all.\n   \n\nOur suspicion finds some more purchase in Onians’ encyclopedic work on the Origins of European Thought. He notes that in the Homeric literature we see that θυμός (thumos)—which is that mortal volition—is an emanation of the blood, and is “destroyed on death.” Thumos-shattering is a famous Homeric death idiom. The aforementioned concept of two-bloodedness; the Proto-Indo-European differentiation between living blood inside the body, and lifeless blood outside, is reflected in the obverse pair of thumos and βροτός (vrotos) “gore.” Thumos being the living blood, and vrotos the lifeless, shed blood; the shattered thumos. \n   \n\nTo linger a moment on the relation of ichor to water, recall the root h₂ep-. Onians points out that ichor is “perhaps related to αἰών (aion), or the liquid of the immortal life-soul and to the water of life.” The original, watery character of ichor is perhaps retained still, in the Promethean myth—where drops of ichor fall from Prometheus’s wounds and cause plants to spring up from the ground where they land. \n   \n\nAt this juncture, one is inclined to point out countless funerary traditions concerning water—in the general sense that, in death, the body evidently dried up and wasted away to rot and dust. Libations of all types seem to contain the symbolic thread of offering moisture as sustenance to the god, for one reason or another, and similarly do we see for example the Minoan “kainag” rites, or Boeotian grave reliefs depicting the hero holding the cup—or the grail; the vessel for the water of everlasting life. The Babylonians designated one as the ‘pourer of water’ in funerary rituals—usually the closest kin of the departed. An old Babylonian curse reads:\n\n​\n\n“May the gods deprive him of an heir and a pourer of water.”\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nLiver and Sky\n\n​\n\nIn moving to understand the relationship between the liver and Jupiter, we’ll begin by examining the practices of the haruspicies of Etruria. The haruspices no-doubt inherited their craft from a lineage extending back to Babylonia in one way or another. In fact the art of divining omens and portents from comparing the liver of a sacrificial animal to the sky is well-documented among the Babylonians. It’s not particularly difficult to understand the magical mechanism of extispicy: Just as food, consumed, is transmuted to blood by the liver and becomes a part of man and his will, so does the sacrifice offered to the god sustain, and integrate with the divine will. The haruspex then, studying the liver, is studying a sacred object which has been consumed by, and assimilated into the godhead. \n   \n\nThe Etruscans give us a clue as to the liver-sky connection in the form of a tradition whereby lightning strikes in certain areas of the horizon were ‘read,’ against the liver. The character of the portent was down to the position, at least, of the bolt of lightning using the liver as a guide analogous to the sky. \n   \n\nThe question of why, however—why the liver was identified with the sky-god, specifically—is more murky. There must be some analogizing train of thought from which the sympathy between the two is the obvious conclusion. Returning to the original root word in the Proto-Indo-European for the blood-within, we again find our footing. That root, *h₁ésh₂r̥, denotes kinship. It signifies fatherly blood; the idea, called agnation, that familial relation was exclusive to the patrilineal line is characteristic of the Pontic-Caspian peoples and their Indo-European descendants. Notions of blood-relatives; being ‘of the same blood,’ so on and so forth, come down to us from the agnatic idea. Agnatic traditions provide a natural, mystical connectivity between the vivifying function of the liver and the divine sky-father, Dyeus Patir. \n   \n\nUtilizing the liver to divine the will of Jupiter (extispicy, haruspicy) is a later, divinatory application, then, of the ancient agnatic idea. We do in fact see that extispicy was a practice attributed to the Scythians—but more in due course.\n   \n\nWilliam Edward Hearn describes the theory of agnation among the Proto-Indo-Europeans, at some length, in his 1887 book on the household. He writes that the mother was, in all likelihood, not considered “of the son’s blood,” pointing to the Hellenic episode in which Orestes was tried for killing his mother Klytemnestra—who murdered his father Agamemnon. On the one hand, Orestes was honor-bound to avenge the death of his father. On the other, it was considered a grave transgression to kill one’s own family member. Orestes argued, successfully, that while Klytemnestra was his mother, she was not of his blood; not like his father. Therefore, she was not his family and the vengeance he exacted for Agamemnon was just. Hearn writes:\n\n​\n\n“—A male was the first founder of the house. His descendants have “the nature of the same blood” as he. They, in common, possess the same principle of life. The life-spark, so to speak, has been once kindled, and its identity, in all its transmissions, must be preserved. But the father is the life-giver. He alone transmits the life-spark which, from his father, he received. The daughter receives, indeed, the principle of life, but she cannot transmit it. She can, at most, be the medium of transmitting another, quite different life-spark. None but males possess this capacity of transmission. None but males, therefore, could maintain the identity of the original life-principle, or could perform the worship of which that principle was the center.” \n\n​\n\nConceiving of the blood as both vivifying—animating; mortifying—and as being transmitted exclusively by the father, results in a clear poetic analogy between the warming, animating lake of blood in the body, its alchemical production in the liver-furnace, and the divine father or “kindler” of that spark in the sky—Dyeus Patir—who occasions to lash out at the earth with miraculous fire in the form of lightning. Is it any wonder then, that the Etrurians attempted to glean some insight into the divine temperament, by studying the fire in the sky against the source of agnation in the body?\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nForefinger\n\n​\n\nTo rightly uncover the role of the forefinger in the liver-sky tradition, we now turn our attention back to the Hellenes; to the mythological people called the Idaean Daktyloi. The Dakytloi (or, “fingers”) are one of a number of different names for what are essentially progenitor tribes—or fathering races—among the Hellenes. The Cretan name for them was Kourites (or Curetes). The name Kourites bears a clear resemblance to the root word koryos; the Proto-Indo-European initiatory cult of warmaking youths—from where comes the word for a young man in the Greek as well: Kouros. The Kourybantes, the Cabieri, and the Rhodian Telchines are all considered somewhat interchangeable for those incoming, settling progenitor tribes: The Daktyloi. Siculus, for example, states that the Cabieri of Samothrace were those same Idaean Daktyloi of Crete. Pausanias explicitly suggests that they are of “Hyperborean” ancestry. He says, concerning the origin of the Olympic Games:\n\n​\n\n“The most learned antiquaries of Elis say that Kronos was the first king of heaven, and that in his honor a temple was set up in Olympia by the men of that age, who were named the Golden Race. When Zeus was born, Rhea entrusted the guardianship of her son to the Daktyloi of Ida, who are the same as those called Kourites. They came from Cretan Ida … Heracles, being the eldest, matched his brothers in a running race, and crowned the victor with a laurel of wild olives … which is said to have been introduced to Greece by Heracles from the land of Hyperboreans, men living beyond the home of the northern wind. Olen was the first to say that from those Hyperboreans Achaea came to Delos.”\n\n​\n\nOther Hyperborean associations will become apparent shortly. The Daktyloi Idaioi—or Kourites—are so-called for their settlement on Crete, on the slopes of Mt. Ida; that is, “The Fingers of Ida.” In fact, the name Cretan is derived from Kourites, meaning the descendants thereof. According to the mythological canon the Daktyloi Idaioi brought to Crete, from Hyperborea, knowledge of healing, of song, and of metalworking. Iron was said to have first been carried out of the bosom of Ida by the Daktyloi. We are reminded in-passing of ample associations in the textual record that identify the art of metallurgy with the Pontic-Caspian peoples. As for song, the poetic “Dactylic” meter is named for the Dakytloi as well. \n   \n\nWhat of healing? Pausanias records that the Daktyloi were five in number—though sometimes they are recounted as three when explicitly described as metallurgists, or ten, where the five brothers are wedded to five sisters. For the five male Daktyloi, their names are typically given as Herakles the thumb, Paianios the forefinger, Epimedes the middle finger, Iasos the ring-finger, and Idas the little finger. We will of course limit the scope of our attention to Paianios.\n   \n\nUnraveling the meaning encoded in the name of the Daktyl Paianios proves challenging. The earliest traditions of healing for the Greeks surround a handful of figures. They are the old god Paian, the centaur Kheiron—literally, “the hand”—and the hero Asklepios. Apollo is typically involved in some honorary or assistive capacity. It’s worth noting that Paion (or Paean) is given by Homer to be the name of a place in a far-northern region, in Thrace, in the Axios river valley. These Paionians would likely have been taken for the same Hyperborean stock, which Pausanias attributed to the Daktyloi Idaioi. Homer makes mention of the “Paionians” as allies of the Trojans. Scholars still debate the particulars.\n   \n\nWe can already begin to see it take shape, that the Greek term commonly employed for a healer, or physician—a “Paian”—was lent to the practitioners of healing arts from that older god Paian, whose name was then eventually reduced to an epithet as his function was subsumed by the newer cults, but whose origins lay in the north—having perhaps come down through Thrace in successive migrations, preserved in the myths of the “Hyperborean” Daktyloi. As a matter of fact, the vast majority of temples to various healing gods; to Apollo and Asklepios incorporated sacred, natural springs. The poet Krates recounts visiting a hot spring, where a sort of hospital called a “Paioneion” was located. \n   \n\nGermane to those older associations is the assimilation of the hands with the magical art of healing. Some trace of this symbolic continuity lingers in the myth of the Daktyloi with the forefinger, thus lending him the name “Paianios.” To draw the most basic connection between these healing traditions and the liver, it can be simply said that one’s health and longevity must obviously have been viewed as a function of the health and strength of the liver.\n   \n\nOne familiar with the esoteric traditions of Indo-European apothecaries may take pause here, however, and raise a question. The medical function is typically ascribed not to the forefinger, but to the ring-finger. The Romans called this digit the medicus, for a number of reasons. Which daktyl, then, is rightly integrated symbolically with the healing arts—the forefinger or the ring-finger? \n   \n\nIn truth, all five Daktyloi have been associated with one curative function or another at some point. What we find upon rigorous interrogation of these themes, names, and records, is a general Indo-European sense that the hand is a tremendously important focus of the healer. With his hands does the physician presume to engage in the divine, curative work, which the body undertakes as a matter of natural inclination. Just as Eliade described the smith (metallurgy being a Daktylic tradition, bear in mind) as “intervening” in the gods’ work of divine embryology by transmuting, and transforming ores in the fire; just as I have elsewhere explained, the architect engages in a divine proportional construction—proportion emanating from the hands’ function in measurement—so too does the physician-seer involve himself in the study of the natural laws of the body; of the house of the soul; and intercede—he directs some degree of its function toward a curative purpose. The notion of the healing touch, or a “healing blow” is, for the Greeks, then at least as old as the teacher of Asklepios—the centaur Kheiron, for his eponymous “hands of healing.”\n   \n\nKheiron was, naturally, the son of Kronos, who, recall Pausanias called the “first king of heaven,” and to whom an altar was set up at Olympia by the Hyperboreans. This would make him a half-brother of Zeus. As a related aside, the operative word χειρουργός (kheirourgos) most nearly translates to ‘surgery,’ and suggests an active, invasive work on the ill or wounded. Kheiron was also the mentor of a number of heroic characters including Iason the Argonaut—who shares his name with the third Daktyl, or medicus finger. Though we can set aside the ring-finger for a later study, some slight effort spent here in comparing the name Iason to Paianios is useful to buttress the forefinger’s linkage to the liver.\n   \n\nThe specific meaning of Παιάν (Paian) and its etymology is uncertain. Ἰάσων (Iason) on the other hand, literally means “I heal.” Iason is derived from the word ἰάομαι (iaomai), “I cure, I repair.” This root word is also of uncertain provenance. However, it has been suggested cautiously by scholars that iaomai has for its source the Proto-Indo-European *mey-, a word, which most nearly meant something like “to strengthen.” In the context of healing magic, such an etymology of course follows naturally. There is also a connotation with movement native to this far-ancient word, preserved in its Sanskrit derivation (iṣaṇyati), meaning literally “to pour out,” “to stream forth,” and idiomatically, to impel, incite, urge; to deliver a speech. In other words, things very much related traditional gestures with the forefinger. \n   \n\nFor its role in signifying command or adjudication, the Romans called the raised forefinger the “ivdex,” or judging gesture—wherefore comes our name, index finger. One last observation to add to the mix is that scholars frequently compare iaomai, again—of uncertain origin—to the word ἰαίνω (iaino). This similar word carries with it the meanings “heating,” “warming,” and “melting,” and corresponds arguably to that aforementioned word in Sanskrit—pouring forth, sending out, and oration. It’s the oratory aspect that closes the circle back round to Paian. \n   \n\nThe Hellenic word usually denotes a practitioner of the healing profession. But, it held another meaning. A “Paian” is a traditional type of song or chant, usually dedicated to the Apollo Paian, or Apollo the healer. Recall that the Daktyloi are said to have brought song and poetic meter to Greece from Hyperborea. On these grounds the suggestion is carefully advanced, that the names Paian and Iason both have their roots in the same soil.\n   \n\nThe most compelling structure from which Paian descended is *παιάϝων (paiawon), meaning one who heals through magic, or more literally, a strike or a blow with the hand. There seems to have occurred, across migration of the Pontic-Caspian peoples and their tongue—over time, a divergence of meanings that were originally bound up in a more closely-related sympathetic rationale. \n   \n\nPerhaps the best way to clarify what’s been said, if only to draw more sharply into relief the way that these symbols come together in tandem, the reader will forgive us some small, illustrative speculation. We might catch a glimpse of a magical healing tradition, springing from these peoples whom the Hellenes called Hyperboreans. The practice appears to have consisted, symbolically, of warming, heating, and melting (as in the vivifying transmutation that occurs in the liver), and of the pouring-forth of vital water—thereby staving off the “cold dryness” of death. There was evidently an oral or vocational portion of this practice; of chanting and incantation. The Hyperborean healing incantation, if some tradition existed, was arguably intended to beseech the sky-father, whose dominion in the body was the seat of life; to let flow the healthy blood-inside, to let flair the agnatic life-spark from which, like a bolt of lightning, the sky-father himself is the ultimate source. \n   \n\nAfter evoking the deity in some form perhaps, the laying-on of hands, or a healing touch (or even a surgical “blow”) might have occurred. One wonders what specific role the forefinger could have played the process; if the Greeks’ naming both the first and the third Daktyl for healing functions is an echo of their ritual function.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nAbaris the Hyperborean\n\n​\n\nA final note on the Hyperborean aspects of the matter is to be found in the Greek school of traveling soothsayers called the ἰατρόμαντις (iatromantis). That name descends from iaomai, like the Daktyl Iason—“I heal.” One of the most prominent iatromantioi was named Abaris the Hyperborean. Being well-known for his miraculous healing magic, the Greeks called him a priest of Apollo. \n   \n\nAbaris is said to have fled his Hyperborean homeland to escape a plague, and it was for that reason he came so far as Greece. He was known for his Scythian dress, for practicing extispicy, for carrying a sacred arrow (atop which Ponticus claimed he traveled by flight), and for subsisting without ever eating. \n   \n\nThe chariot, of course, was an invention of these Hyperboean peoples, and it is worth noting that in its earliest form, the chariot was outfitted with two soldiers: A driver, and an archer. Similarly, among the Greeks, the Cretans were typically attributed the invention of the bow and arrow; the Cretans, who were fathered by the Kabieri, or Hyperborean Daktyloi. Plato called Abaris a Thracian (recall the northerly, Homeric Paian of Thrace), who’s magical medicinal practice was conducted with epodai, or by means of incantation."

  "content": "\"Some man of yore \nA nomenclature thought of and devised, \nAnd forms sufficient found. \n…\nSo thought he good to make the stellar groups, \nThat each by other lying orderly, \nThey might display their forms. And thus the stars \nAt once took names and rise familiar now.\"\n\n \n\nAratos\n\n \n\nThe origin of the constellations is still open to conjecture, for, though all nations since the dawn of history have recognised these ancient stellar configurations, and at one period or another employed them in some symbolic or representative capacity, the fact remains that the researches of archaeologists have failed to yield definite proof as to who first designed them and where they were first known. \n   \n\nThere is little doubt that the constellations were the result of a deliberate plan, as La Place affirms. Possibly they were an endeavour on the part of some patriarch of the ancient world to grave an imperishable record of a great event, or a series of noteworthy occurrences in the world’s history, for all posterity to read, and although no Rosetta stone has been found as yet to enable the present race of man to decipher their meaning, still the problem attacked by the ablest savants of all nations has yielded theories respecting the origin and purposes of the constellations that cannot be far from the truth. \n   \n\nIn the very dawn of the world, when human instinct first inspired observation, primitive man began to look about him and take stock of his environment. The daily wants of nature supplied, the natural phenomena would claim man’s attention, and first he would take cognisance of the sun, moon, and stars that provided life’s chief essential, light. \n   \n\nFor purposes of identification alone, there must have been at an early date certain designations for the individual stars that gave rise to all subsequent stellar nomenclature. The sun, moon, and planets, the brighter luminaries, would first excite man’s interest and attention, and then the brightest stars would attract and mystify him. \n   \n\nAs time went on, observation would soon indicate to human intelligence the relationship of the sun and moon to the fixed stars, and the seasonable difference in the appearance of the nocturnal skies. \n   \n\nAll this would be in strict accord with the natural laws of the observational faculties. Such elementary knowledge of the heavenly bodies would presently lead to the establishment of certain facts relative to the stars, features concerning their apparent change in position, that if marked would render a service to the race. \n   \n\nVery early in the history of the world the stars must have served to record the passage of time, a service they have faithfully and accurately rendered mankind through all the ages to the present day. \n   \n\nThe first tillers of the soil must have marked well the stars, and certain of them doubtless proclaimed the time of sowing and reaping. The circumpolar stars guided the rude crafts of the early navigators, and unquestionably in the earliest times they singled out “the star that never moves,” Polaris, as an unfailing and reliable beacon to direct their course. \n   \n\nThe rising and setting of the stars thus became matters of paramount importance, governing alike the actions of the husbandmen and those who sailed the seas. Certain stars were also indicative of impending meteorological changes, and their appearance at particular seasons was watched for with keenest interest. \n   \n\nThe wonder and mystery the stars inspired, and their utility in daily life, soon led to their becoming objects of idolatry, and as their importance increased, astrology, that pseudo-science, Kepler’s “foolish daughter of a wise mother,” sprang into being, and for a time suppressed, discouraged, and hampered the legitimate and scientific study of the heavens. \n \n\nThus early in the history of man we find the stars all-important to his welfare. No course was pursued or plan adopted without first consulting the heavenly bodies. They governed alike the policies of nations and the actions of individuals. They ruled absolutely over the destinies of the high and lowly, the rich and poor, and horoscopes became a necessity of life, and divination the highest pursuit of man. \n   \n\nIn Sabianism, or star worship, we have, therefore, the earliest form of religion, and in astrology and the adoration of the stars the progenitors of the modern science of astronomy. \n   \n\nFrom this universal attention to the stars, there sprang up the myriad fancies and peculiar notions, the products of imagination, that peopled the sky with animals and quaint figures, and gave rise to the constellated stellar groups that have come down to us, and figure on the modern charts of the heavens. \n   \n\nThere are many traditions that have emerged from the mists that shroud the distant past respecting the origin of the constellations, and the science of astronomy, and as that origin is antediluvian, the knowledge that we have of the subject must perforce be largely traditional in its character.\n   \n\nAn early tradition affirms that the immediate descendants of Adam cultivated a knowledge of the stars, and that Seth and Enoch inscribed upon two pillars, one of brick, the other of stone, the names, meanings, secret virtues, and science of the stars, with the divisions of the zodiac. \n \n\nJosephus states that he saw in Syria the pillar of stone, which alone remained in his day. The history of two mysterious pillars entwined with a serpent, the symbol of revolution, can be traced through all the ages, from remote antiquity until it reaches our dollar sign.\n   \n\nThen there is a tradition that has survived the ages, that Noah, who was also known as Oannes and Janus, was the inventor of astronomy. It is certain that Noah and his family were soon worshipped and inextricably mixed with stars and gods. \n   \n\nThe Chaldeans attributed their knowledge of the stars to Noah, who became a two-faced deity, as he could look backwards and forwards. He was known as “the God of Gates,” as he opened the door which God shut, and Noah and the Ark became Janus and Jana, solar and lunar deities. Of all this tradition meets us everywhere. \n   \n\nIt is a remarkable fact that, from the earliest times, as far as we can judge from the cuneiform inscriptions and hieroglyphics that have been deciphered, the sign for God was a star. \n   \n\nAstronomy unites with history and archaeology in pointing to the Euphrates Valley, and, as we might expect, the region of Mt. Ararat, as the home of those who originated the ancient constellation figures. \n   \n\nAuthorities agree, for the most part, that the originators of Sabianism and stellar lore in this region were not the Semitic Babylonians, but a people generally termed “Akkadians,” a word meaning highlanders, or mountaineers, the most ancient race known to us, who came down from the mountainous region of Elam or Susiana, to the east of Assyria, bringing with them the rudiments of writing and civilisation. \n   \n\nThe Babylonians, previous to the invasion of the Akkadai, unquestionably had some knowledge of the stars. It was thought in those early times that the mountains on the east supported the firmament, and that the zenith was fixed over Elam. There were observatories established in all the large cities of Chaldea, many of the shrines on the topmost terraces being dedicated to this purpose, and at an early date the stars were named and numbered. \n   \n\nThe Babylonian Tablets, the oldest records extant, reveal that the Akkadians introduced their sphere and zodiac into Babylonia before the year 3000 B.C., and the zodiac of the Akkadians corresponds almost exactly with the signs we know to-day. \n   \n\nIt seems almost folly to endeavour to set the date of the invention of the constellations, for that period must approximate the age of the habitable world, and in all probability the stellar figures known to us were not designed at any one time, and lost their originality by the varying conditions that time has wrought in the past, for even in comparatively recent years there have been many attempts to alter them. \n   \n\nBailly, a brilliant scholar and eminent astronomer, contends that the phenomena of astronomy had been closely observed before the great races of mankind separated from the parent stock. He claims, and few would dispute him, an antediluvian race as the originators of astronomical science. In proof of this he cites the fact that there are ancient Persian records which refer to the four famous “Royal Stars” as having marked the four colures (the meridian points of the solstices and equinoxes), a fact only possible in antediluvian times. \n   \n\nMaunder, who has made a very careful study of archaeology in its relation to the constellational figures, has revealed many interesting features in connection with them. He writes:\n\n \n\n“The first feature which the old constellation figures present to us is a very striking one. They cover only a portion of the heavens, and a large region roughly circular in the southern hemisphere is left entirely vacant. Swartz was the first to make the significant suggestion that this space was left vacant because the inventors of the constellations lived too far north to permit of their viewing this part of the heavens.” \n\n\nPursuing this line of thought. Maunder considers that the designers of the figures lived, in all probability, between 36° and 42° north latitude, so that the constellations did not originate in Egypt or Babylon. By computing where the centre of the vacant space coincided with the southern pole, we get the date 2800 B.C., which was probably the date when the ancient work of constellation making was completed. \n   \n\nIt has been remarked that among the constellation figures conspicuous by their absence are the following animals: the elephant, the camel, the hippopotamus, the crocodile, and the tiger, so it is reasonably safe to assume that neither India, Arabia, nor Egypt was the birthplace of the sphere. Greece, Italy, and Spain may be excluded on the ground that the lion figures as one of the constellations. We have left Asia Minor and Armenia, a region bounded by the Black, Mediterranean, Caspian, and Aegean seas, as the logical birthplace of the stellar figures. The fact that we find a ship among the stars warrants us in believing that it is on the coast of this country, and not in its interior, that we should expect to find the land where the constellations were first known. \n   \n\nThe division of the zodiac into twelve signs, the number of months in the year, is one of very great significance, for we infer from the fact that it was so arranged to assist in the observation of the position of the sun among the stars. \n   \n\nMany of the authorities hold that the zodiac was planned while the spring equinox fell in the constellation Taurus. In support of this claim it may be said that, if this is the case, the sun was ascending through the signs that face the east, and was descending all through the signs that face the west, a significant and logical arrangement which could hardly be accidental. \n   \n\nThe date of the zodiac is given as 3000 B.C., which agrees very well with the significant position of the four Royal Stars previously mentioned which marked the four cardinal points, and were thus especially prominent. \n   \n\nA close inspection of the stellar groups yields many points of interest, notably the fact that everywhere there is indication of design and not chance in the arrangement and configuration. There seems to have been a definite idea in some one’s mind respecting them, a desire to perpetuate a vitally important record. It may be of interest to mention a few of the facts that have inclined scholars to this belief: \n   \n\nTo begin with, we find many figures duplicated, and in most cases the two figures are close together in the sky. Thus we see the figures of two Dogs, two Bears, two Giants subduing Serpents, each pair in close proximity. Then there are two Goats, two Crowns, two Streams, and two Fishes bound together. \n   \n\nThe zodiacal constellations are often clearly connected with neighbouring figures. We observe the Bull attacked by the Giant Hunter Orion, Aquarius pouring a stream of water into the mouth of the Southern Fish, the Scorpion attempting to sting Ophiuchus, and the Ram pressing down the head of the Sea Monster. \n   \n\nAgain, one portion of the sky was known to the ancients as “the Sea,” and here we find, as we might expect, many marine creatures,—the Dolphin, the Whale, the Fishes, the Sea Goat, and the Southern Fish. \n   \n\nOther features in support of the theory of design are found in the half-figures, Pegasus, Taurus, and Argo, and the so-called Deluge group, comprising the Ship stranded on a rock, the Bird, the Altar, the Centaur offering a sacrifice, and the Bow set in the Cloud. \n   \n\nIt is supposed that, at a time far remote, the Akkadians were conquered by the Semitic race, and that the conquerors imposed only their language on the conquered, adopting, it is said, the Akkadian mythology, laws, literature, and system of astronomy. \n   \n\nAt an early date in the world’s history we find astronomy and astrology flourishing in China, India, Arabia, and Egypt. \n   \n\nThe early astronomical annals of the Chinese reveal the fact that, before the year 2357 B.C., the Emperor Yao had divided the twelve zodiacal signs by the twenty-eight mansions of the moon. [1]\n   \n\nThe Arabians are said to have received their astronomical knowledge from India, and in China, Arabia, and India we find an almost identical system, i.e., that of the Lunar Stations, or Lunar Mansions, employed to indicate the daily progress of the moon amid the stars. \n   \n\nIndia has been claimed as the birthplace of the constellation figures, but modern research, says Allen, finds little in Sanscrit literature to confirm this belief. \n   \n\nThere is a controversy as to whether Indian astronomy was derived from Greece or independent of it. In support of the latter theory, it is said that the Brahmins were too proud to borrow their science from the Greeks or Arabs, and also that it was improbable that two rival Hindu sects, the Brahmins and Buddhists, should have adopted the same innovations in their calendars and religious symbolism. Again, the Greeks held Indian astronomy in high esteem, while the Hindus only bestowed a moderate praise on the Grecian science. \n   \n\nThe Egyptians, on whose early monuments the twelve zodiacal signs are found, acknowledged that they derived their knowledge of the stars from the Chaldeans, and they were in turn the teachers of the Greeks as early as the time of Thales and Pythagoras. \n   \n\nHerodotus states that the Egyptians were the first of all mankind who invented the year and divided it into twelve parts, a statement much at variance to the accepted testimony of the Babylonian Tablets. \n   \n\nOf the constellations outside the zodiac, we find a few groups and stars mentioned at an early date, notably in the Old Testament, where, in the Book of Job, there are references to the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, names that have come down to us. Homer and Hesiod both mentioned the same constellations, which is indicative of the importance of these star groups in the eyes of the ancients. Hesiod also refers to the stars Arcturus and Sirius, and these two stars may well be considered the most ancient of all the stars from the standpoint of stellar nomenclature. \n   \n\nAuthorities differ as to the source from which the Greek knowledge of the stars was derived, but in all probability it did not come from any one source but was imported from Egypt, Chaldea, and Phoenicia. \n   \n\nThe founder of the science of astronomy in Greece was Thales, the head of the Ionic School of Philosophy, a citizen of Miletus, who lived about 540 B.C. It is said that he first taught the Greek navigators to steer by the Little instead of the Great Bear. \n   \n\nEudoxus, a native of Cnidus, who lived about the fourth century B.C., a contemporary of Plato, was the first Greek who described the constellations with approximate completeness. He is reported to have visited Egypt and to have there received astronomical instruction. He wrote The Enoption, or The Mirror, and The Phenomena or Appearances, both prose works and unfortunately not extant, but Aratos, the Alexandrine poet, versified the latter work about 270 B.C., and it has descended to our day. \n   \n\nAratos was a native of Soli in Cilicia, and Court Physician to Antigonus Gonatas, King of Macedonia. He was a contemporary of Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Theocritus, and he always mentions the constellations as of unknown antiquity. His sphere accurately represented the heavens of about 2000 B.C. His poem has been considered an authority on stellar nomenclature, and has been closely followed by all subsequent delineators of the constellation figures. \n   \n\nThis sphere of Eudoxus, which has been transmitted to us through the verses of Aratos, contained forty-five constellations, twenty in the northern hemisphere, twelve in the southern, and thirteen in the zodiacal group, the Pleiades being considered as a separate constellation in addition to Taurus. \n   \n\nAllen makes the following interesting reference to this famous poem: “When the poem entitled The Phenomena of Aratos was introduced at Rome by Cicero and other leading characters, we read that it became the polite amusement of the Roman ladies to work the celestial forms in gold and silver on the most costly hangings, and this had previously been done at Athens, where concave ceilings were also emblazoned with the heavenly figures.” \n   \n\nThe Phenomena is the most ancient description of the constellations extant, and has been translated into all languages. Cicero and Germanicus Caesar both made translations of it, and no less than thirty-five Greek commentaries on the work are known to us. \n   \n\nEudoxus considered the heavens as divided up into constellations with recognised names. “He did not deal with the stars singly, but gave a sort of geographic description of their territorial position and limits, according to groups, distinguished by a common name.” His work’s chief value consists in the comprehensive view of the heavens it affords, and in the description of the constellated heavens in their entirety. \n   \n\nAlthough the contributions of Eudoxus and Aratos to astronomical literature are highly regarded and authoritative, the acknowledged founder of our scientific astronomy is Hipparchus, who was the first to discover the perpetual and apparent shifting of the stars known as the Precession of the Equinoxes. Only two of his works have come down to us, his Commentary, and the reproduction of his Star Catalogue by Ptolemy, who was known as “the Prince of Astronomers.” This catalogue enumerated 1022 stars, of which 914 form constellations, and 108 are unformed. It is held in much respect even by modern astronomers, and agrees in the main with the enumeration of Aratos. Procyon, however, appears as a constellation, and the asterism Equuleus, the foremost Horse, is added, an asterism that figures on modern star maps. The observations of Hipparchus were made between 162 and 127 B.C., while those of Ptolemy embodied in the Syntaxis, as his work was entitled, were made from 127 to 151 A.D. \n   \n\nThe Syntaxis was practically an epitome of the results of the early star-gazers of Greece and Western Asia, and comprised a list of 1028 stars classified in forty-eight constellations. Each star is named by its position in the figure supposed to include the stars of the group. Thus the constellation Draco contains thirty-one stars, some of which received the following descriptive names: “the star upon the tongue,” “the star in the mouth,” “the star above the eye,” etc. This method of naming the stars continued in use until the eighteenth century, when a letter or a number with the Latin genitive of the constellation was used. In Ptolemy’s catalogue appears the first comparative list of stellar magnitudes. \n   \n\nThe constellations of the Greeks were ultimately accepted and adopted by the Persians, Hindus, Arabs, the nations of Western Asia, and the Romans, from whom they have been borrowed by the modern world. To Greece, then, we are indebted for the figures now depicted on our celestial globes and the many interesting myths associated with them, notably the legend of Perseus and Andromeda, which is fully illustrated in the starry skies. \n   \n\nAlthough the savages of prehistoric times first bequeathed the stellar configurations to science, we listen to their harsh ideas, as Bacon puts it, “as they come to us blown softly through the flutes of the Grecians.” \n   \n\nFrom the time of Ptolemy till the year 1252, no advance of importance was made in the matter of cataloguing the stars, but in this latter year there appeared the celebrated Alphonsine Tables compiled by Arabian or Moorish astronomers at Toledo under the auspices of the subsequent King Alphonso X., known as “the Wise.” \n   \n\nA correction of Ptolemy’s sphere was published by the Arabian astronomer Ulugh Beg in 1420 a.d., in which there was a description of the constellations derived from Al-Sufi’s translation of five centuries previously. \n   \n\nThe catalogues of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe followed, the former’s great work laying the foundations of modern astronomy. In 1603 the Uranometria of Johann Bayer appeared in Germany. This chart contained forty-eight constellations and a list of 709 stars. Bayer invented the system in vogue to-day of denoting each star by a letter of the Greek alphabet, the brightest star in each figure being designated Alpha with the Latin genitive of the constellation. It was soon found that the stars in many of the groups exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, and such stars were denoted by the letters of the Roman alphabet. \n   \n\nSucceeding Bayer’s catalogue there appeared consecutively the charts of Bartsch, Schiller, Kepler, Royer, Halley, and in 1690 that of Hevelius, who added the asterisms of the Hunting Dogs, the Giraffe, the Lizard, the Unicorn, the Lynx, the Sextant, Fox and Goose, and Sobieski’s Shield, all recognised by modern astronomers. [2] \n   \n\nFlamsteed’s catalogue, published in 1719, comprised fifty-four constellation figures, and exhibited a new method of stellar designation, the stars being consecutively numbered in the order of their right ascension, a method employed in modern charts for the fainter stars. \n   \n\nLa Caille, known as “the true Columbus of the southern sky,” in his publications of 1752 and 1763, invented fourteen new star groups which included the names of many instruments of the sciences and fine arts, the majority of which have been rejected by modern delineators of the constellations. \n   \n\nSubsequently Le Monnier, Bode, and Lalande published stellar catalogues, adding new asterisms, the latter’s chart containing a total of eighty-eight constellations. \n   \n\nIn 1840 the famous German astronomer Argelander published his star catalogue, the most complete that had appeared up to that time. It contained 210,000 stars. Argelander brought order where there had been much confusion, by separating one constellation from another by irregular boundary lines, so that all the stars would be embraced within the borders of some stellar figure. His system is employed in many of the modern charts of the heavens. [3] \n   \n\nTo-day there are over a hundred large catalogues of the stars, but there is a discrepancy in the number of constellations accepted by astronomers. Prof. Young recognised sixty-seven as in ordinary use, and in these northern latitudes about fifty-five are generally known. \n   \n\nAllen tells us that “eighty or ninety may be considered as now more or less acknowledged, while probably a million stars are laid down on the various modern maps, and this is soon to be increased perhaps to forty million on the completion of the present photographic work for this object by the international association of eighteen observatories engaged upon it in different parts of the world.” \n   \n\nIn conclusion, it may be of interest to review briefly the conception of the firmament in vogue in ancient times among the different nations of the old world. \n   \n\nThe Persians are said to have considered 3000 years ago that the whole heavens were divided up into four great districts, each watched over by one of the “Royal Stars,” Aldebaran, Antares, Regulus, and Fomalhaut.\n   \n\nThe Assyrians looked upon the stars as divinities, endowed with beneficent or evil powers. \n   \n\nAmong the Chaldeans the sky was regarded as a boat, shaped like a basket. The space below was the earth, which was flat and surrounded by water. \n   \n\nThe Egyptians worshipped Osiris and Isis as ancestors, and showed Plutarch their graves, and the stars into which they had been metamorphosed. \n   \n\nThe ancient Peruvians thought that there was not a beast or bird on earth whose shape or image did not shine in the sky. They considered the luminaries and stars guardian divinities and worshipped them. They also thought that the stars were the children of the sun and moon. \n   \n\nThe Hebrews had a notion that the sun, moon, and stars danced before Adam in Paradise. \n   \n\nThe Bushmen, or early inhabitants of Africa, regarded the more conspicuous stars as men, lions, tortoises, etc. They believed that the sun, moon, and stars were once mortals on earth, or even animals, or inorganic substances which happened to get translated to the skies. \n   \n\nIn New Zealand heroes were thought to become stars of greater or less brightness according to the number of their victims slain in battle. \n   \n\nThe North American Indians believed that many of the stars were living creatures, and knew Ursa Major as a Bear, the same figure known in the Far East. \n   \n\nThe Tannese Islanders divided the heavens into constellations with definite traditions to account for the canoes, ducks, and children that they see in the skies. \n   \n\nIn the South Pacific islands dying men will announce their intention of becoming a star, and even mention the particular part of the heavens where they are to be looked for.\n   \n\nThe Eskimos thought that some of the stars had been men and others different sorts of animals and fishes, which was also the mythical belief of the Greeks and Romans. \n   \n\nAccording to Slavonic mythology the stars are regarded as living in habitual intercourse with men and their affairs. \n\n \n\nAn ancient legend was that there were no stars till the giants of old, throwing stones at the sun, pierced holes in the sky, and let the light of that orb shine through the holes which we call stars,—and Anaximenes thought that the stars were fixed in the dome of heaven like nails. \n\n \n\nThus we find, as some one has put it, that “astronomy like a golden thread runs through history and binds together all tribes and peoples of the earth,” and the girdle of stars we view nightly remains as the most ancient monument of the work of intelligent man, “the oldest picture book of all.”"

  "title": "Woman, and the Modern Martyr",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/woman-modern-martyr",
  "content": "Woman\n\n​\n\nA correspondent has written me an able and interesting letter in the matter of some allusions of mine to the subject of communal kitchens. He defends communal kitchens very lucidly from the standpoint of the calculating collectivist; but, like many of his school, he cannot apparently grasp that there is another test of the whole matter, with which such calculation has nothing at all to do. He knows it would be cheaper if a number of us ate at the same time, so as to use the same table. So it would. It would also be cheaper if a number of us slept at different times, so as to use the same pair of trousers. But the question is not how cheap are we buying a thing, but what are we buying? It is cheap to own a slave. And it is cheaper still to be a slave.\n   \n\nMy correspondent also says that the habit of dining out in restaurants, etc., is growing. So, I believe, is the habit of committing suicide. I do not desire to connect the two facts together. It seems fairly clear that a man could not dine at a restaurant because he had just committed suicide; and it would be extreme, perhaps, to suggest that he commits suicide because he has just dined at a restaurant. But the two cases, when put side by side, are enough to indicate the falsity and poltroonery of this eternal modern argument from what is in fashion. The question for brave men is not whether a certain thing is increasing; the question is whether we are increasing it. I dine very often in restaurants because the nature of my trade makes it convenient: but if I thought that by dining in restaurants I was working for the creation of communal meals, I would never enter a restaurant again; I would carry bread and cheese in my pocket or eat chocolate out of automatic machines. For the personal element in some things is sacred. I heard Mr. Will Crooks put it perfectly the other day: “The most sacred thing is to be able to shut your own door.”\n   \n\nMy correspondent says, “Would not our women be spared the drudgery of cooking and all its attendant worries, leaving them free for higher culture?” The first thing that occurs to me to say about this is very simple, and is, I imagine, a part of all our experience. If my correspondent can find any way of preventing women from worrying, he will indeed be a remarkable man. I think the matter is a much deeper one. First of all, my correspondent overlooks a distinction which is elementary in our human nature. Theoretically, I suppose, every one would like to be freed from worries. But nobody in the world would always like to be freed from worrying occupations. I should very much like (as far as my feelings at the moment go) to be free from the consuming nuisance of writing this article. But it does not follow that I should like to be free from the consuming nuisance of being a journalist. Because we are worried about a thing, it does not follow that we are not interested in it. The truth is the other way. If we are not interested, why on earth should we be worried? Women are worried about housekeeping, but those that are most interested are the most worried. Women are still more worried about their husbands and their children. And I suppose if we strangled the children and poleaxed the husbands it would leave women free for higher culture. That is, it would leave them free to begin to worry about that. For women would worry about higher culture as much as they worry about everything else.\n   \n\nI believe this way of talking about women and their higher culture is almost entirely a growth of the classes which (unlike the journalistic class to which I belong) have always a reasonable amount of money. One odd thing I specially notice. Those who write like this seem entirely to forget the existence of the working and wage-earning classes. They say eternally, like my correspondent, that the ordinary woman is always a drudge. And what, in the name of the Nine Gods, is the ordinary man? These people seem to think that the ordinary man is a Cabinet Minister. They are always talking about man going forth to wield power, to carve his own way, to stamp his individuality on the world, to command and to be obeyed. This may be true of a certain class. Dukes, perhaps, are not drudges; but, then, neither are Duchesses. The Ladies and Gentlemen of the Smart Set are quite free for the higher culture, which consists chiefly of motoring and Bridge. But the ordinary man who typifies and constitutes the millions that make up our civilisation is no more free for the higher culture than his wife is.\n   \n\nIndeed, he is not so free. Of the two sexes the woman is in the more powerful position. For the average woman is at the head of something with which she can do as she likes; the average man has to obey orders and do nothing else. He has to put one dull brick on another dull brick, and do nothing else; he has to add one dull figure to another dull figure, and do nothing else. The woman’s world is a small one, perhaps, but she can alter it. The woman can tell the tradesman with whom she deals some realistic things about himself. The clerk who does this to the manager generally gets the sack, or shall we say (to avoid the vulgarism), finds himself free for higher culture. Above all, as I said in my previous article, the woman does work which is in some small degree creative and individual. She can put the flowers or the furniture in fancy arrangements of her own. I fear the bricklayer cannot put the bricks in fancy arrangements of his own, without disaster to himself and others. If the woman is only putting a patch into a carpet, she can choose the thing with regard to colour. I fear it would not do for the office boy dispatching a parcel to choose his stamps with a view to colour; to prefer the tender mauve of the sixpenny to the crude scarlet of the penny stamp. A woman cooking may not always cook artistically; still she can cook artistically. She can introduce a personal and imperceptible alteration into the composition of a soup. The clerk is not encouraged to introduce a personal and imperceptible alteration into the figures in a ledger.\n   \n\nThe trouble is that the real question I raised is not discussed. It is argued as a problem in pennies, not as a problem in people. It is not the proposals of these reformers that I feel to be false so much as their temper and their arguments. I am not nearly so certain that communal kitchens are wrong as I am that the defenders of communal kitchens are wrong. Of course, for one thing, there is a vast difference between the communal kitchens of which I spoke and the communal meal (monstrum horrendum, informe) which the darker and wilder mind of my correspondent diabolically calls up. But in both the trouble is that their defenders will not defend them humanly as human institutions. They will not interest themselves in the staring psychological fact that there are some things that a man or a woman, as the case may be, wishes to do for himself or herself. He or she must do it inventively, creatively, artistically, individually—in a word, badly. Choosing your wife (say) is one of these things. Is choosing your husband’s dinner one of these things? That is the whole question: it is never asked.\n   \n\nAnd then the higher culture. I know that culture. I would not set any man free for it if I could help it. The effect of it on the rich men who are free for it is so horrible that it is worse than any of the other amusements of the millionaire—worse than gambling, worse even than philanthropy. It means thinking the smallest poet in Belgium greater than the greatest poet of England. It means losing every democratic sympathy. It means being unable to talk to a navvy about sport, or about beer, or about the Bible, or about the Derby, or about patriotism, or about anything whatever that he, the navvy, wants to talk about. It means taking literature seriously, a very amateurish thing to do. It means pardoning indecency only when it is gloomy indecency. Its disciples will call a spade a spade; but only when it is a grave-digger’s spade. The higher culture is sad, cheap, impudent, unkind, without honesty and without ease. In short, it is “high.” That abominable word (also applied to game) admirably describes it.\n \n\nNo; if you were setting women free for something else, I might be more melted. If you can assure me, privately and gravely, that you are setting women free to dance on the mountains like mænads, or to worship some monstrous goddess, I will make a note of your request. If you are quite sure that the ladies in Brixton, the moment they give up cooking, will beat great gongs and blow horns to Mumbo-Jumbo, then I will agree that the occupation is at least human and is more or less entertaining. Women have been set free to be Bacchantes; they have been set free to be Virgin Martyrs; they have been set free to be Witches. Do not ask them now to sink so low as the higher culture.\n   \n\nI have my own little notions of the possible emancipation of women; but I suppose I should not be taken very seriously if I propounded them. I should favour anything that would increase the present enormous authority of women and their creative action in their own homes. The average woman, as I have said, is a despot; the average man is a serf. I am for any scheme that any one can suggest that will make the average woman more of a despot. So far from wishing her to get her cooked meals from outside, I should like her to cook more wildly and at her own will than she does. So far from getting always the same meals from the same place, let her invent, if she likes, a new dish every day of her life. Let woman be more of a maker, not less. We are right to talk about “Woman;” only blackguards talk about women. Yet all men talk about men, and that is the whole difference. Men represent the deliberative and democratic element in life. Woman represents the despotic.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Modern Martyr\n\n​\n\nThe incident of the Suffragettes who chained themselves with iron chains to the railings of Downing Street is a good ironical allegory of most modern martyrdom. It generally consists of a man chaining himself up and then complaining that he is not free. Some say that such larks retard the cause of female suffrage, others say that such larks alone can advance it; as a matter of fact, I do not believe that they have the smallest effect one way or the other.\n   \n\nThe modern notion of impressing the public by a mere demonstration of unpopularity, by being thrown out of meetings or thrown into jail is largely a mistake. It rests on a fallacy touching the true popular value of martyrdom. People look at human history and see that it has often happened that persecutions have not only advertised but even advanced a persecuted creed, and given to its validity the public and dreadful witness of dying men. The paradox was pictorially expressed in Christian art, in which saints were shown brandishing as weapons the very tools that had slain them. And because his martyrdom is thus a power to the martyr, modern people think that any one who makes himself slightly uncomfortable in public will immediately be uproariously popular. This element of inadequate martyrdom is not true only of the Suffragettes; it is true of many movements I respect and some that I agree with. It was true, for instance, of the Passive Resisters, who had pieces of their furniture sold up. The assumption is that if you show your ordinary sincerity (or even your political ambition) by being a nuisance to yourself as well as to other people, you will have the strength of the great saints who passed through the fire. Any one who can be hustled in a hall for five minutes, or put in a cell for five days, has achieved what was meant by martyrdom, and has a halo in the Christian art of the future. Miss Pankhurst will be represented holding a policeman in each hand—the instruments of her martyrdom. The Passive Resister will be shown symbolically carrying the teapot that was torn from him by tyrannical auctioneers.\n   \n\nBut there is a fallacy in this analogy of martyrdom. The truth is that the special impressiveness which does come from being persecuted only happens in the case of extreme persecution. For the fact that the modern enthusiast will undergo some inconvenience for the creed he holds only proves that he does hold it, which no one ever doubted. No one doubts that the Nonconformist minister cares more for Nonconformity than he does for his teapot. No one doubts that Miss Pankhurst wants a vote more than she wants a quiet afternoon and an armchair. All our ordinary intellectual opinions are worth a bit of a row: I remember during the Boer War fighting an Imperialist clerk outside the Queen’s Hall, and giving and receiving a bloody nose; but I did not think it one of the incidents that produce the psychological effect of the Roman amphitheatre or the stake at Smithfield. For in that impression there is something more than the mere fact that a man is sincere enough to give his time or his comfort. Pagans were not impressed by the torture of Christians merely because it showed that they honestly held their opinion; they knew that millions of people honestly held all sorts of opinions. The point of such extreme martyrdom is much more subtle. It is that it gives an appearance of a man having something quite specially strong to back him up, of his drawing upon some power. And this can only be proved when all his physical contentment is destroyed; when all the current of his bodily being is reversed and turned to pain. If a man is seen to be roaring with laughter all the time that he is skinned alive, it would not be unreasonable to deduce that somewhere in the recesses of his mind he had thought of a rather good joke. Similarly, if men smiled and sang (as they did) while they were being boiled or torn in pieces, the spectators felt the presence of something more than mere mental honesty: they felt the presence of some new and unintelligible kind of pleasure, which, presumably, came from somewhere. It might be a strength of madness, or a lying spirit from Hell; but it was something quite positive and extraordinary; as positive as brandy and as extraordinary as conjuring. The Pagan said to himself: “If Christianity makes a man happy while his legs are being eaten by a lion, might it not make me happy while my legs are still attached to me and walking down the street?” The Secularists laboriously explain that martyrdoms do not prove a faith to be true, as if anybody was ever such a fool as to suppose that they did. What they did prove, or, rather, strongly suggest, was that something had entered human psychology which was stronger than strong pain. If a young girl, scourged and bleeding to death, saw nothing but a crown descending on her from God, the first mental step was not that her philosophy was correct, but that she was certainly feeding on something. But this particular point of psychology does not arise at all in the modern cases of mere public discomfort or inconvenience. The causes of Miss Pankhurst’s cheerfulness require no mystical explanations. If she were being burned alive as a witch, if she then looked up in unmixed rapture and saw a ballot-box descending out of heaven, then I should say that the incident, though not conclusive, was frightfully impressive. It would not prove logically that she ought to have the vote, or that anybody ought to have the vote. But it would prove this: that there was, for some reason, a sacramental reality in the vote, that the soul could take the vote and feed on it; that it was in itself a positive and overpowering pleasure, capable of being pitted against positive and overpowering pain.\n   \n\nI should advise modern agitators, therefore, to give up this particular method: the method of making very big efforts to get a very small punishment. It does not really go down at all; the punishment is too small, and the efforts are too obvious. It has not any of the effectiveness of the old savage martyrdom, because it does not leave the victim absolutely alone with his cause, so that his cause alone can support him. At the same time it has about it that element of the pantomimic and the absurd, which was the cruellest part of the slaying and the mocking of the real prophets. St. Peter was crucified upside down as a huge inhuman joke; but his human seriousness survived the inhuman joke, because, in whatever posture, he had died for his faith. The modern martyr of the Pankhurst type courts the absurdity without making the suffering strong enough to eclipse the absurdity. She is like a St. Peter who should deliberately stand on his head for ten seconds and then expect to be canonised for it.\n   \n\nOr, again, the matter might be put in this way. Modern martyrdoms fail even as demonstrations, because they do not prove even that the martyrs are completely serious. I think, as a fact, that the modern martyrs generally are serious, perhaps a trifle too serious. But their martyrdom does not prove it; and the public does not always believe it. Undoubtedly, as a fact, Dr. Clifford is quite honourably indignant with what he considers to be clericalism, but he does not prove it by having his teapot sold; for a man might easily have his teapot sold as an actress has her diamonds stolen—as a personal advertisement. As a matter of fact, Miss Pankhurst is quite in earnest about votes for women. But she does not prove it by being chucked out of meetings. A person might be chucked out of meetings just as young men are chucked out of music-halls—for fun. But no man has himself eaten by a lion as a personal advertisement. No woman is broiled on a gridiron for fun. That is where the testimony of St. Perpetua and St. Faith comes in. Doubtless it is no fault of these enthusiasts that they are not subjected to the old and searching penalties; very likely they would pass through them as triumphantly as St. Agatha. I am simply advising them upon a point of policy, things being as they are. And I say that the average man is not impressed with their sacrifices simply because they are not and cannot be more decisive than the sacrifices which the average man himself would make for mere fun if he were drunk. Drunkards would interrupt meetings and take the consequences. And as for selling a teapot, it is an act, I imagine, in which any properly constituted drunkard would take a positive pleasure. The advertisement is not good enough; it does not tell. If I were really martyred for an opinion (which is more improbable than words can say), it would certainly only be for one or two of my most central and sacred opinions. I might, perhaps, be shot for England, but certainly not for the British Empire. I might conceivably die for political freedom, but I certainly wouldn’t die for Free Trade. But as for kicking up the particular kind of shindy that the Suffragettes are kicking up, I would as soon do it for my shallowest opinion as for my deepest one. It never could be anything worse than an inconvenience; it never could be anything better than a spree. Hence the British public, and especially the working classes, regard the whole demonstration with fundamental indifference; for, while it is a demonstration that probably is adopted from the most fanatical motives, it is a demonstration which might be adopted from the most frivolous."

  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/divination-hands-i",
  "content": "In overture to his 1930 tract on the origins of religion H.L. Mencken wrote that its single function is to “give man access to the powers that seem to control his destiny, and to … induce those powers to be friendly to him.” Nothing else, says Mencken, is essential. \n   \n\nThere is a basic predisposition in man to view an effect as in some way symbolic of a cause. The mystics of old noticed—each in their own manner, and together in the form of the canon—that everything in the world which changed according to some force of nature, did so, in such a way as to characterize the force which changed it. \n   \n\nThe elemental conceit of the mystic is this: The world, to some extent, is intelligible. Through observation of the rational motion of the world, the mystic therefore worked to gain some understanding of the immaterial principles which dictated its motion. Wherein the course of his work quantitative reasoning approached its limitations, as it does, there, qualitative reasoning took over seamlessly—arranging petty, measured information into symbolic arrays so as to be consistent with the apparent character of the world.  \n   \n\n“Divination,” then, only names the varied efforts employed by the mystic to study the causal forces, as they are revealed to him, in the specific forms of their effects. For the simple reason that man himself causes nothing without some internal will to do so, it stood to reason for the mystic, that the forces of nature were likewise imbued with metaphysical volition. Therefore study of the effectual forms led him to knowledge of the causal forces, which then in-turn provided him some avenue to attain a degree of divine gnosis: Beyond the observation of what occurred, but according to what logic or rule, and therefrom, perhaps what was fated to occur. \n   \n\nThe specific school of magical study with which we are here concerned is that of divination conducted through scrutiny of the lineaments of the hand. Over the centuries that practice has been given many different names in the West. Most share the pattern of a similar form: Chiromancy or Cheiromancy, both of which are phonetic renderings of the Greek; Kheiromancy being perhaps a more generous formulation therefrom. Palmistry is another name and it descends from a Proto-Indo-European root denoting the ‘flat’ of the hand. \n   \n\nBy the Renaissance, authors intent to redress the practice in the fashionable language of scientific inquiry elected to replace the Greek μάντις, which, in that time was already much-loosened from its original meaning. Mantis was derived from the Proto-Indo-European for ‘thinking,’ ‘perceiving;’ a form that likewise rendered the word mens into latin. Even still the suffix -mancy, applied to the various divinatory arts from time immemorial, was far too rife with the connotation of superstition for the tastes of those nascent empiricists of the Renaissance. There was the simple need to rename it more suitably for the time. Logos served to connect the practice to other scientific inquiry. Thus it seems that Chirologia or Chirology came into popular use. Many alleged practitioners today still cling to this term, probably for that very reason.\n   \n\nKheiromancy is, historically, among the most widely perverted and diffuse practices. And yet, in modern times, its erstwhile consideration is rather loudly ignored in level discussion of the Western esoteric crafts. Surely the reason for its glossing by serious regard, for now something like over a century, is due to the quasi-scientific fog thrown up around the tradition by dilettantes, beginning with the Renaissance and carrying through (and beyond) the age of surgical theater. \n \n\nThen, just as now, the most dangerous sort of instructor is the one who manages to become well-read without also learning to dispel, with prejudice, the pretensions of his particular time. He who sees, but does not understand; who speaks, but not from experience. Unfortunately for those of earnest curiosity the trouble with that sort is not, as it were, the possibility of encountering a foolish teacher and disabusing oneself of him too late, but rather, it’s the question of how to escape from the droves of foolish teachers in the first place. The answer to this question is methodological, of course, and peculiar to the individual. Alas. Still, there are some persistent claims as to the early history of kheiromancy, which are long-overdue critical treatment. \n   \n\nThe issue of origin for the kheiromantic traditions has apparently always been a bit of a mess. Those who’ve taken any interest in the issue since the Enlightenment; Messers. Beamish, Cheiro, d’Arpentigny, Desbarrolles (whose most exhaustive work has yet to be translated to English properly), and so on, only entertain the subject in a preliminary manner; rare as they are. All are rather keen to get on with the show—of elucidating and distinguishing their own individual methods. Most only treat the history of the craft insofar as it serves to justify themselves as an authority whose methods can be trusted. And yet, all seem to agree rather nebulously that whatever it was at the moment of its inception, kheiromancy must surely have been invented in India. \n   \n\nWhile it’s true that the oldest mentions of the practice are indeed belonged to the Vedas, the case happens to be that only one such attestation actually remains tenably dated. What’s more, despite the fact that the Vedic tradition is the oldest surviving record of such a practice, there’s ample reason to suppose that kheiromancy entered into the Indian subcontinent much earlier, as one of the myriad cultural institutions brought with the Pontic-Caspian migrations. But more in due course.\n   \n\nBy the 17th century the fledgling study of philology tentatively identified Sanskrit as an Indo-European language. It was a profound discovery. The simple fact alone persists, and proves an undeniably resilient criticism of even the most stalwart of the Indian nationalist revisionists. From the 18th through the early 20th centuries—at the height of fashion for those more ‘scientifically’ aspected tracts, for better or worse, the various Vedic and Vedic-inspired texts had neither been so widely distributed, nor, crucially, so rigorously dated. \n   \n\nAt that time a significant number of those Vedic sources were considered to date from as early as 3,000 BCE. The Puranas, for example, which explicitly discuss the kheiromantic practices of the Samudrika Shastra, were long considered to have been authored by the same mythological chronicler of the far-ancient Rigveda. Though today, all eighteen Puranas are confidently dated to the common era. The only mention of kheiromancy which is considered, for certain, to be older than just the 6th century BCE—that is, younger even than the Homeric tradition in Greece—is a single line from the Atharvaveda, which is now dated to 1200 BCE at the most generous. \n   \n\nThe next uncontested Vedic attestation of such a practice comes in the works of the legendary poet Valmiki—though no earlier, it seems, than the 6th century. Even then the particular attestation is not explicitly kheiromantic. Rather, Valmiki makes mention of a related school of physiological divination. Many are given only to assume that its mention also corroborates the existence of the associated kheiromantic practice as well. Well-founded or not, the fact is only as such.\n   \n\nValmiki is also given for the author of an alleged tract that no longer survives, which apparently comprised precisely 567 stanzas, and which elucidated his teachings on kheiromancy specifically in the male hand. Though the dilettantes who mention it commonly suggest this particular tract of Valmiki’s was stupendously ancient; written in the 3rd millennium BCE—Valmiki himself lived no earlier than 500 BCE. If such a tract existed it was either erroneously attributed to Valmiki far later, or, it obviously could not have been authored earlier than he himself lived. Perhaps a copy of that specific work is the very same mysterious book Cheiro claims to have been shown by reclusive sages India, early in his career; which he described as bound in human skin and lettered in gold, and which they would not let him reproduce or scrutinize overmuch. But then perhaps not.\n   \n\nIrrespective of the paucity of textual attestations on behalf of the Vedic traditions, it ought still to be offered—as if in defense—that even in the Atharvaveda, the single kheiromantic allusion describes an arguably well-formed school of thought. There is the specific notion of metaphysically important inscriptions located in the hands. There is the idea of special separation between right and left; there is a sense of temporal distinction. And, there is the sense both of what is ensured about a man by the divine, as well as, what effect he may have according to his own free action. \n   \n\nRegardless, by the time the works of Valmiki appear, generally speaking, so too have kheiromantic traditions appeared in Greece, traveled so far as China, entered Arabia, and been repeated in the Levant. In relatively short order we find textual mention of the commonality of the practice in the works of a Roman playwright—and even recorded personally by the Emperor Hadrian as practiced by his grandfather Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus. Though Juvenal ridicules the gypsies rifling the pockets of superstitious women in the forum with palmistry, Hadrian’s recollection of the divinatory interests of his grandfather demonstrates that, even then, the very idea that the lineaments in a man’s hand were laid-down according to some cosmic will, could be found in one form or another, everywhere from the lips of the lowest charlatans, to the austere consideration of the highest offices. \n   \n\nAristotle makes several remarks in the course of his writing, dated to the 4th century BCE, which discuss the apparent relationship between the lines in a man’s palm and the length of his life. In the first volume of his De Historia Animalium, Aristotle describes the hands, writing:\n\n​\n\n“The inner surface of the hand is the palm (thenar) which is fleshy and divided by lines; in long-lived persons by one or two lines, which go right across, in short-lived by two which do not go right across.”\n\n​\n\nFrom one perspective the passage might be taken in the sense that Aristotle is dealing with common claims, in as-exclusive and as-certain a manner as he possibly can. In other words, did Aristotle simply invent the association between longevity and incisions on the palm, here, out of thin air? Or is he perhaps addressing what was then already a more widely held sensibility—in such a manner as to say only what could be certainly said of it? Namely, that as far as he was concerned, the straightness and length of the major lines were indicative of health and longevity, in some way, but no more. \n   \n\nPliny the Elder records in the eleventh book, one-hundred fourteenth chapter of the Naturalis Historia, his own astonishment that Aristotle should ever have deigned to commit such things to paper. Pliny writes that he, for his part, remains “quite convinced of the utter futility” of the view that “there are in the human body certain prognostics of the duration of life.” Out of his towering respect for Aristotle, and upon seeing that Aristotle apparently did not “treat it with contempt,” the elder Pliny reproduces the former’s sparse thoughts on the matter anyway. Perhaps Pliny’s distaste for the materialistic inclination to ‘wring data’ out of an otherwise symbolic art ought to be viewed not-so-much as a scoff at the notion of divination itself (a position in which Cicero was happy to wallow), but rather, as a subdued nod toward the specific difference between that which Juvenal mocked, and that which Hadrian revered. \n   \n\nMention ought be made of another Aristotelian curiosity. There exists a commonly-repeated legend in which Aristotle is said to have discovered a gold-lettered treatise on the subject of kheiromancy, lying on an altar to Hermes in Egypt. Recognizing it to be a sacred work of tremendous erudition Aristotle allegedly commended the book to the care of Alexander the Great, his student, who in-turn read it with great interest and employed its teachings to read the palms of his generals. Perhaps this tale only mythologizes the relationship between Alexander’s conquest of India and a subsequent revival of kheiromantic practice in the West. In truth little can be said for certain. An individual called Hispanus is thought to have translated that legendary treatise into Latin, which was then finally to be reprinted in 1490 in Ulme, under the title Chyromantia Aristotelis cum Figuris. The author of this odd Renaissance work is traditionally given as Aristotle himself.\n   \n\nA similar story can be found sprent liberally across the early-modern introductory literature. This one concerns the Emperor Caesar. Allegedly, Caesar received a young man in his company who presented himself as a prince of here-or-there. Caesar is said to have taken his hand, and by scrutiny of his palm, declared the fellow an imposture. Of course Caesar was vindicated soon thereafter when some further information revealed his judgement to have been correct. For this supposed instance, in-kind, no source of even the slightest antiquity can be furnished. Anaxagoras is also often said to have either authored a treatise on kheiromancy, or simply to have practiced and taught it. The source of this strange and specific claim appears to be no older than the writings of the 19th century mystic Cheiro, who specifies the year 423 BCE for Anaxagoras’s work on the subject—as if to be referencing something in particular. But Cheiro provides no such reference. He simply says as much. Whatever material it was that led Cheiro to make such a statement remains mysterious at best, and dubious at worst. \n   \n\nBy the time of Nietzsche, and thereafter that of Guénon, the philological discipline experienced several revolutions. Over the course of the ensuing century archaeological research was both tempered and invigorated by philological reconstruction, according among others to the pioneering work of Karl Verner, and to the Junggrammatiker at Leipzig. The peoples we now call “Proto-Indo-Europeans” (or for the sake of a bit of Hellenic drama, Hyperboreans) have been, at last, recalled to memory with some degree of specificity. It is undoubtedly from those people that the practice of kheiromancy originates. \n   \n\nWith the conquests and migrations of the Hyperborean peoples and the accompanying dissemination of their culture and language, the essential, primordial kheiromantic principles must have arrived in the Indian subcontinent. This Eastern branch persisted at the very least in some ancient form, for some time—and it was this to which the Atharvaveda alluded as early as the 13th century BCE. The Chinese lineages of similar kheiromantic practice are evidently related to, and descended from this earlier Vedic school of thought. Eventually the Vedic practices were somewhat codified in the form of the Hast Samudrika Shastra, which survived into the common era (for example, as discussed in the Puranas). \n   \n\nAlternatively, the same originating Hyperborean canon—as I have only just begun to demonstrate elsewhere—evidently found its way West directly into Greece. Carried East from the Pontic Caspian steppe into India, yes, but also carried West from that same foregoing people. Distant tolls of that ancient, westgoing tradition are preserved in the both in Greek memory and in the Greek language, and, perhaps elsewhere in the Indo-European traditions only yet to be recognized. Only much later—in the Middle Ages—was the cousin branch in the East was recorded in its Arabized form, mingled together with Arabic translations of earlier Greco-Roman writing, and then subsequently reencountered by Medieval Europeans in the 12th and 13th centuries. It remains to be seen to what, if any, commonalities are discernible between that Hyperborean healing tradition, given over as it was to the symbolic language of the hand, and the ancient Vedic tradition.\n   \n\nThe question remains: What is the simple line of rational analogy that led the early Dorians to conceive of their ancestors according to the form of the hand; why call the Hyperboreans “Daktyloi?” The answer is, as ever, evident enough to the sympathetically minded. The very oldest sages apparently viewed the hand as a microcosm of the man, much as man was understood to be, himself, in proportion with the cosmos. In the hand are four primary dactyls, which correspond to the four primary appendages of the body. Each possesses three divisions and joints as in the knuckles of the fingers; the hip, knee and ankle; the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. \n   \n\nIn the form of his thumb, or pollex, man is unique among the rest of the nature’s creatures in that the thumb is set in clean opposition to the motion of the fingers. Various Renaissance authors explain that even in the higher-primates, the thumb is situated so as to work with the fingers whereas in the hand of man alone does the thumb work against the fingers. On account of that configuration man is able to create, with his hands, works the likes of which no other creature is capable. Manly P. Hall points out in his own recounting of that Renaissance argument that there is surely some similar meaning contained with the Rabbinic statement that God has set himself ‘against his children.’\n   \n\nThus throughout much of the Western tradition, while the four fingers have material associations with organs in the body, the pollex is typically associated with the will in its capacity to go against the body; to conceive of the metaphysical through bodily torment—with the proper venerial sense of Eros. Or, in the sense that the four-threes of the fingers pertain to the twelve aspects of the empyrean, the thumb then symbolizes the unity; the primum movens; or the creative antagonism."

  "content": "It’s not historically uncommon for a particular, elite contingent of professional soldiers to come to define the reputation of a given army. Under certain conditions—given the lifestyle, equipment, tactics, and experience of a select band of fighters—the degree to which they could establish and control the character of the battlefield distinguished them even above generals, and the nations they served. The fame and notoriety of those contingents often demoralized opponents simply by their deployment. Serving as shock troops, as the hardened core of a formation, or as personal body guards, warriors of that calibre both defined and destroyed dynasties throughout history.\n   \n\nIt is the definitive nature of violence, which requires it to be incorporated as a pillar of power. No government which does not in some capacity monopolize violence will not survive the inevitable test against one that does. At small scales, like many tribal societies, chieftains are characterized by their ability to provide security for their people. While this can mean responsibility for management of resources, of work details, and of relationships within the tribe, the finality of violent solutions often requires that the chief be capable of commanding the respect of the warrior element—in order to lead them. Perhaps the most base element of that command is that the chief be a potent fighter in his own right. \n   \n\nBoth arming those entrusted with power, and necessitating the service of the nobility in the ranks of professional soldiery are common tactics—as demonstrated by the European chivalric class, the samurai, boyars, huscarls, and the myriad ‘chosen bands.’ However, as the scale of society increases the dexterity required to effectively prosecute executive decisions means that power must still be concentrated in relatively few people. This is true even of the broader democratic polities. Contrarily, the larger an empire becomes the more people and land it must secure, and so, the larger its military will become. \n   \n\nThus in governments of the relevant scale, the rulers will be as few as one man, whereas the armies will be many thousands. The vagaries of rule may require a king to dote upon his other structures of power to the detriment of his military arm for the simple fact that many such attentions are zero sum, and make precarious the balance of his reign. In these situations it becomes beneficial to have some segment of the military set apart and above the rest. Two simple requirements must be met, before all else: Special martial prowess, and exceptional loyalty to the throne. \n   \n\nThe mere reputation of such elite troops can dissuade civil unrest, rebellion, and attempted coup d’etat. In some respect, the elite soldiery offers a superior violence to the rest of the military, and in so doing, keeps them loyal to the interests of the nation—or at least their ruler—instead of pursuing more selfish aims. It is also natural, of course, that the most important man retain the most capable body guards.\n   \n\nThe circumstances are common enough that elite guard units appear frequently throughout history. And though there are earlier examples, the Praetorian guard are perhaps the best known. Initially, Praetorian guards were an informal conglomerate of companions to the general of Roman armies, but they were eventually formalized as the general’s specific body guard even after the office of Praetor was discontinued. Toward the end of the Republican era the Praetorian guard was composed of hand-picked veteran soldiers, to ensure the safety of commanders on the field. As the importance of particularly loyal soldiers increased during the civil war period, Octavian and Mark Antony both expanded the size and role of their Praetorian troops. \n   \n\nMen had plenty of reasons to aspire to membership in these cohorts. In addition to the prestige, they received double pay and a reduced term of service. Due to the importance of their proximity to the Emperor, they were allowed to construct their own compound in the city in much the same format as more traditional legionary border forts. The rewards of the position served the dual purpose of ensuring loyalty—making them more difficult to bribe—and as a lure, to retain the most capable soldiers and make them willing to risk exchanging their lives for their emperor’s when called to do so.\n   \n\nOther, similarly reputed units did less service as direct guards of the seat of power. The Russian Streltsy, as example, were initially recruited from tradesmen as particularly capable frontline troops. The Streltsy employed early firearms with expertise, and wielded poleaxes to devastating effect on the battlefield. While many contingents were consistently employed on distant fronts, there were others stationed permanently in Moscow. It was politically useful to have a mail-clad fist at the ready in the capital for any failures of the open hand. Like the Praetorians before them, whose guardian position kept them often far from war, the Streltsy were soon assigned to guard, to police, and to fire brigade duties. Whenever they were to be found without a war, the Streltsy and Praetorians sometimes ended up behaving more as secret police—wielded against civilian targets. Yet, boggy and miresome as the political enterprise is, it’s rare that anyone is able to police it without themselves being drawn in. \n   \n\nNaturally, any party present at court will be subject to its intrigues, and that simple fact is not something of which any ruler would have been ignorant. While some felt that the dividends of those powerfully positioned, native troops were worth the costs, others would want to have their cake and eat it too, so to speak. Specialized foreign troops, mercenaries, or in some cases, kidnapped children could be formed into famously dangerous troops—whose own far-removed homes would keep them more naturally separate from political webs. They would, it was hoped, be loyal only and above all to their one connection to that land; to the personage of its ruler or at the very least, to his purse. \n   \n\nMany potent warriors of medieval Scandinavia made their names serving in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. Notorious for their stature, for their heavy armor, and for wielding the formidable Dane axe, the Varangians were decisive in many battles over several centuries. They were commonly to be found serving as personal guards for the last emperors of Rome, and were feared privateers in the Mediterranean beyond their role as heavy shock infantry. The Varangian Guard were perhaps inspired by the Germani Corporis Custodes of the Julio-Claudians, a troop of 500 soldiers recruited from the Roman rhinelands as a supplementary guard, to that offered by the Praetorians. It seems that even at this early date in the empire, the Praetorians were already too politically fraught to trust completely—but too powerful to disband outright. Both the Varangians and the Germani found themselves vested with particular trust exactly because they were not Roman. While their foreign ties made it harder to sway these soldiers, they still had families and interests of their own—which could be used as leverage to turn them against those they were meant to protect.\n   The Varangians, the Germani Corporis Custodes, the Praetorians, and Streltsy, each—at one time or several—played decisive roles in carrying out coup d’etats against their rulers. Frequently they were themselves the perpetrators. Each had their own reasons, often resulting from tricky political circumstances wherein fractured power structures made loyalty futile. Notably, the Varangians are recorded as having knelt to the murderer of their Emperor when his killer was to succeed him, as their duty was to the office and not the man. Yet, they were convinced at other dates to depose one Emperor in favor of another. The Praetorians, with such close proximity to their own Emperor in the often tumultuous transitions of power in Rome, found that they had a very profitable influence over the course of events. \n   \n\nSometimes king-making can be as simple as being the first party to yell a name. Such was the case with Emperor Claudius’ coronation by the Praetorians—after having created the vacancy, themselves. Just as armed men will not allow themselves to starve, they will not allow themselves to be placed at too great a distance from control over their own destiny. Decades later, the Praetorians even went so far as to attempt to auction-off the throne to the highest bidder. In Russia, discontented from long campaigns that separated them from the privilege of trading, which was a part of their station, the Streltsy marched on Moscow and attempted to replace the Tsar. Little more explanation need be given than to note that the difference between a dog, and wolf is most evident on a hungry night, though, it takes a wolf to stand above the hounds.\n   \n\n​Even so, many of these units served their roles admirably through the tests of battle. They were, in every case, soldiers who looked upon the glory of their service and station with pride. Loyalty to their ruler was a matter of personal identity. It was perhaps in noticing this characteristic of elite soldiery at its finest, that a new regimen of recruitment was devised. Often while material wealth might draw a guard aside, a strong sense of duty could keep him against whatever odds he was pitted—and so extreme enlistment measures were attempted in order to master the virtue of the perfect soldier.\n   \n\nThe Mamelukes and Jannisaries of medieval Islam were recruited first as slaves, frequently from the Balkan regions, and from the sons of Christians. They were made part of the soldiering class in special schools, set apart from society, and were unable to take a wife or to enter into mercantile enterprise until they were forty years of age—owing particular loyalty to the sultan. They were brought up with an unshakable faith, and with the belief that what comforts and prestige to which they were now entitled were only a matter of supreme generosity on the part of their sultan; luxuries that would have been foreign to them, had they remained with their families. \n   \n\nIn particular, that strict personal discipline, which extended to unit cohesion, gave them a seamless countenance that struck abject fear into their foes. These units became famously competent and presented a dangerous force on the battlefield—trusted as well to be steadfast against intrigue. Their utility certainly seemed to outweigh the cost of their continued procurement, to the point that they eclipsed the usefulness of any other contemporary military apparatus. As a direct result, the Mamelukes overthrew the established government of Egypt and established their own dynasty, ruling with some success. \n   \n\nThe Ottoman Jannisaries realized that they did not actually need to rule, in order to achieve their aims. They gave any privileges they envied to their class, enriched themselves, and prevented any reforms which might diminish their influence. Any sultan that was uncooperative with their policies could be easily replaced for the simple reason that they controlled the palace, and were the backbone of the army. It was many decades before the sultanate threw off their yoke, but it serves to illustrate that more drastic measures can of course yield more drastic results. It seems that even absent influence from without, a man will always have his own desires. \n   \n\nThe manners in which the legend of a band of soldiery might be turned back upon their masters are not limited to usurpation of power. The Polish Hussars, for example; the famously skilled and deadly cavalry who carried out the largest mounted charge in history—managed their own obsolescence. Originally made up of skilled Hungarian mercenaries, but later composed entirely of Polish nobles at their height, the Hussars used their political power to perpetuate the unit well beyond its effectiveness. They transitioned slowly from an elite combat unit to one suited exclusively for parade. The honor of their reputation allowed them to confidently resist change, and age-out their once innovative tactics and weapons, until their characteristic methods had no use but show. Eventually, politically appointed soldiers of no practical use were commonly derided as ‘arm-chair hussars’. The Jannisaries’ own political exertions allowed them to resist change in the much the same way, and, they were ousted precisely because they allowed themselves to become outmoded. \n   \n\nMore tragically, the deadly repute of the elite band can undo the morale of the general soldiery, even when they are serving exactly as intended. At Dyrrachium, the Varangians—fighting against Norman incursions in Italy; vengeful, and confident in their prowess—lead a disastrous charge in which many of their number died. Upon their retreat, the morale of the rest of the Byzantine army was completely unsalvageable. A counter charge by the Normans lead to a general route. The defeat of such dangerous and pre-eminent warriors as the Varangians made any more regular soldiery feel instantly outmatched. \n   \n\nSimilar events played out during the battle of Waterloo. The veteran-elite of Napoleon’s middle guard fled under the weight of fusillade fire, a hitherto unthinkable turn of events, which, caused much of the French army to flee. It is worth noting, however, that the ‘grumblers’ of Napoleon’s old guard insisted on death before surrender, and covered the retreat.\n   \n\nOne may rashly conclude—given all this—that despite their effectiveness, it’s a mistake to allow an elite unit of soldiery to accrue some mythic reputation. But such would certainly be a failure to understand the truth of circumstance. Namely: That any distinction between political power and military power is ultimately an illusion. One cannot exist without the other, and any attempt to widen the separation between the two will profit only an eventual balancing of the scales. The strength of that pillar; of controlled violence, upon which any reign depends is founded upon its competence, but, its longevity is dependent on maintenance. Nothing withers the roots of power so thoroughly as taking them for granted. The decline of each of these specialty troops, which often precipitated the fall of their corresponding nation, can be traced with clarity to particular failures of upkeep. The decay often sets in most immediately when the honor of a position is commodified by handing it out to those undeserving of it. Such is the nature of hereditary appointment—as with the Streltsy and Jannisaries—which caused them to drift away from being a skilled crop of handpicked warriors, to become only a set of ceremonial positions cloaked in a certain aesthetic of military power; hardly fit for war. \n   \n\nAnother source of rot is the stagnation; be it with respect to tactics, to weapons, or to grit, which results from stations far from battle. This was the the specific nature of the downfall of both the Praetorians and the Hussars. Kept, as they were, from the crucible of war for long enough that the dross was no longer able to be separated from the steel. Under pacified circumstances like these, the rust of political intrigue becomes inevitable. Finally there is the corrosive effect of those rulers who imagine that their station is not, at a primeval level, defined by their simple ability to keep hold of it. It’s a lapse in judgement that can only invite those who do, in fact, conduct the fighting to assume total authority—for a king’s grip on power is exactly as tight as it is on his sword."

  "title": "Locating Conang's Tower",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/locating-conangs-tower",
  "content": "According to the myths, ancient Ireland was once held and ruled by a race called the Fomorians. The center of their power was an island tower-fortress named for their king: The Tower of Conand, or Conang. Scholars have long-wondered after the location of Conang’s tower. Wherever it was, so little remains that the question of its site remains up for debate.  As is the case with nearly every ‘barbarian’ European tradition, the oldest texts at-hand are no older than the Christian scribes, whose monastic orders recognized the utility of committing the existing tradition to paper in a Christianized form. One may begin by studying Roderick O’Flaherty’s translation of the Ogygia from the original Irish, together with the Lebor Gabála Érenn, and the Annals of the Four Masters, all of which were first catalogued and composed by Christian scribes. While O’Flaherty was questioned on his particular account of the tower, he received enough defense that debate of the issue was taken up by later historians and linguists.\n \n\nThe tower figures most prominently into the story of the tragic fate of the Nemedians at the hands of the Fomorians. The Nemedians were so-called for their chief Nemed, whose lineage was traced back to the sons of the biblical Noah; an addition, which I suspect was incorporated by the monks. It’s worth noting that Nemed is a religious term in Old Irish related to the druids in particular, and so it’s likely that as a mythological hero, he needed to be reclaimed for Christendom. \n \n\nWhen they arrived in Ireland from Scythia, having survived shipwreck and other tribulations, the Nemedians encountered the Fomorians. The myths tell us that King Conang and his Fomorians quickly subjugated the Nemedians, and forced them to submit to a particularly cruel tribute. Every year the Nemedians were made to give up two thirds of their annual produce, including children, at the field of Magh Cetne. \n   \n\nEventually the Nemedians were bolstered with reinforcements from their Scythian homeland. They struck at Conang’s tower, then, as the myths say, both by land and by sea. The battle was fearsome. Portions of the fortress were captured and razed by the Nemedians. When the fighting subsided and following the departure of the Nemedians’ allies, they were attacked once again by Fomorian reinforcements. At that point both forces were so distracted by the battle on the strand, that they did not have time to respond to the spring tide rolling in. Those who remained of both armies drowned, nearly to a man. Only a scant few Nemedians survived. It was they who went on to split Ireland into thirds among themselves, according to lines drawn radiating from the island—called ‘Tor Inis.’ \n \n\nThere is a wide spectrum of credulity afforded by modern scholars to the events of the Nemedian siege of Conang’s tower. Some historians do not even regard the Fomorians as a real people acting in opposition to the Nemedians, but rather, argue that they are simply symbolic of the callous, natural forces in the world—like death, or night. O’Flahtery is more open to the idea that the Fomorians were a true occupying force in need of an actual site for their fortifications. Committed to take that position, he and his later supporters set out to determine which of the many hundreds of Irish islands might be the legendary ‘Tor Inis;’ to locate the site of king Conang’s tower.\n \n\nFor etymological reasons Tory Island, in the far north of County Donegal, was quickly suggested as the probable location for the tower. Despite ongoing arguments about Tory Island being a poor fit for Tor Inis, it’s still generally mentioned as the ‘likely’ location by academic consensus. The argument proposes that ‘Torach,’ as it was referred to in the initial histories, is derived from the word for tower and so must therefore recall the legendary fortress of the Fomorians. \n \n\nThere are, however, some interesting counter-arguments supplied by a later author—Henry Morris—which suggest that it’s unlikely ancient authors would conflate Tor Inis and Torach without explicitly relating the two. That is to say, if a place was known by many names, it was the habit of ancient authors to name them all. We will not linger overlong on the finer philological points, for lack of expertise. Morris makes several further points about why Tory island is a poor location for the Tower, both of which are of interest.\n \n\nFirst, Tory island is located some eight miles out to sea from the northern coast of County Donegal. The obvious question is how Tory island could have been assailed by ‘land and sea,’ as the Nemedians are said to have done at Tor Inis, when it’s surrounded by miles of open ocean. Secondly, the field of Magh Cetne—where tribute was to be rendered—is located in County Sligo, which is many miles south from the northern coast of County Donegal. One would would have had to cross the entire distance, and then undertake a journey by boat those eight miles out into the sea in order to reach Tory island. It makes little sense for overseers so cruel as to demand two thirds of the annual goods of Ireland, children and all, to undertake the logistics of delivery themselves. Morris makes special note of these poor logistics. More naturally, rulers would  demand tribute to be rendered much more locally, as a rule of convenience. Take, for example, the establishment of the Danelaw. The proximity is a threat, so that the oppressed might look upon the weight of the force against-which they would have to revolt. \n \n\nThese two observations illustrate a tendency toward over-simplicity which is rather common to materialistic pictures of the past—dismissive as they occasion to be, of the descriptive language of the original texts, on the grounds that the chroniclers must have lapsed in their charge for some nonspecific reason. What doesn’t fit with the fashionable interpretation of the data is waved-away as ‘poetic’ or ‘symbolic’ by those with little interest in poetry and little understanding of symbolism. \n \n\nConsider the excavation of Troy by Schliemann, which, created a substantive base for reevaluating the Illiad as an article of history. Before Schliemann plundered the site, Troy was considered by academic consensus to be an entirely mythological construction of ancient authors. A mistake, which is perhaps less rare than modern academics would like to acknowledge. King Arthur, cast as Lucius Artorius Castus, is a well-known example of a glove and a hand, though if it is one being made to fit, or made to fit is hardly conclusive. \n \n\nOral histories are often composed more holistically, in-tandem with legend and religion, than they are with specific attention to material fact. That composite picture, which Evola called the intersection of “history and superhistory,” grows hazy when the myth in question is inevitably passed through another cultural continuum (often more than once) before it comes at last under modern scrutiny. This is the particular case with Celtic legend. For the Celts, as with the vast majority of mythological canona, the stories were only put to the pen with the arrival of the Christian monks, as they came. \n \n\nDespite the tendency for a myth to migrate around a region, geography is never an arbitrary feature. Where the goddess Aphrodite made landfall, or where Zeus was raised in secrecy are both events with disputed localities. So it comes to pass that several villages might claim to be the birthplace of a famous hero, or a dozen mountains named as the lair of the same dragon. According to the Cretans, for example, Zeus was born on Crete near Mt. Ida. Little known, however, is that the Arcadians believed—according to the poet Callimachus—that Zeus was born in Arcadia, on Mt. Lykaion. There is a ridge, there, which derives its name from the same word as “Crete” and, the Arcadians even point to a specific cave where Rhea gave birth—just as the Cretans do on Ida.\n \n\nIn the specific case of Conang’s tower academics fixate on the roots of place-names, almost exclusively. It’s an attitude that results in the advance of theories, which, hinge on strange convolutions of language and transliterations in order to justify their position. Tory’s impressive appearance from the coast, which might reasonably be described as ‘towering’, is poetic enough. The idea that the island lacks a beach for the legendary battle to play out; the battle which was the actual substance of the myth itself; can be set aside as flowery language, or as a flight of literary fancy invented by a genre author, not unlike we might find on an end-cap at the local bookstore.\n \n\nMorris, for his part, suggests Dernish island in County Sligo for the likely home of Conang’s tower—for these reasons in addition to his own etymological redress of the situation. As it happens, Dernish is even more well suited to a fortress than Morris suggests in his own writings. Dernish is a tidal island, meaning that when the tide is low, it is accessible by land. This specific fact sets the stage for the distracted Nemedians and Fomorians to be swept away by the sudden spring tide. However, Morris doesn’t go further into this geographical point, perhaps thinking his argumentation already sufficient. \n \n\nUnfortunately, Tory island is still broadly accepted as the home of Conang, so it will serve to consider more generally the purpose of a fortress. In locating the ideal fortress there is a misconception that it should be situated at the most desolate, furthest removed location. This concept labors under the illusion that there it would be the most difficult to assail. Aside from the fact that it would also be the most difficult to supply, it could not serve any function aside from some last futile respite. Futile, because no siege need be mounted on a distant mountain or desolate island if they can be deprived of resources from more arable regions. The primary utility of a fortress is as a force multiplier, allowing a smaller army to keep a larger at bay, while preventing that army’s passage around it with the threat of the garrison attacking their baggage train.  So, broadly speaking, a fortress is best situated along a major artery of travel so as to control all movement through the area. The more centrally located the fortress, the broader its area of influence can be and the better it can serve as a deterrent to, or in mitigation of opposing armies.\n \n\nThe position of a fortress on a tidal island is hardly unprecedented. The coming and going of the tide allows the sea to form a more effective, and perilous moat than any man-made trench. That the drawbridge is only lowered on a tidal calendar is a small price to pay. The region hosts several famous fortifications on tidal islands to this day. Mont-Saint Michel in Normandy, Saint Michaels Mount in Cornwall, and Castle Tioram in Lochaber were all built on tidal islands. Mont-Saint Michel and Castle Tioram both served as seats for their ruling lords, and all three proved pivotal points of contention for ruling the regions in which they were situated. They manage this because they straddle well the line between defensibility of position, and adjacencies to major thoroughfares to threaten attack. Any fortress which cannot threaten attack on major roads for the movement of troops and supplies can be summarily circumvented at little cost. \n \n\nThus, while Tory is isolated at the far northern point of Ireland and adrift in the sea, Dernish, by contrast, is more centrally located. Still northerly, but stationed along the main coastal roads moving north, and south, and east—while also defending Sligo bay. Only in consideration of the source material as an account of men, who must live as we live, and think as we think can the legend be resolved reasonably with its setting. Holding our ancestors at arms length, disdaining them as foolish, credulous, and fearful, is perhaps only to accuse them of what we most fear in ourselves. It’s an attitude that creates an academic distance across which we can discern precious little of our history, and because of which, we deprive ourselves of our inheritance."

  "content": "Far before the arrival of the Greeks, before the time of Abraham, before the heresy of Akhenaten and the descent of Ishtar, the great works left by Vedic craftsmen quietly assured mankind that their skills were not an invention—but were, even in that age, an inheritance. All the argumentation about the specifics lurking in the recesses of the Indus suggests to us, in one manner or another, the story of an age of original learning so ancient and so distant that we cannot help now but forget it. The Great Year was clearly known to careful observers since time immemorial, and its notice must have required a tremendous degree of sophistication and time. As Cheiro says, “—how many centuries elapsed before such changes came to be observed and noticed it is impossible to even estimate.”\n \n\nA student of architecture may stop and wonder. We take for granted that an ‘alignment’ in a structure is a way of signifying something. But what is it about the arrangement of material along an axis, or in such a way as to be ‘oriented with respect’ to something, that lends the whole thing into sympathetic confluence with that other thing toward-which, or after-which it’s arranged? It serves to revisit an idea offered at the beginning of the former article in this pair. The mystic and the craftsman are like brothers. \n \n\nAs the world experiences motion and change—in a word, as life proceeds—it’s physically transformed moment-by-moment according to underlying laws. For the mystic, understanding of certain laws of nature invites him to postulate as to the character of others. He supposes. He concludes. He philosophizes, and considers the boundary between physical and metaphysical; between symbol and material. He wonders after the very fact that the mind is able to intuit anything at all—that things are in any way intelligible. The mystic’s art is translating metaphysical ideas into physical terms, and in so-doing, managing the loss of ‘resolution’ with poetic means. \n \n\nFor the craftsman, understanding of certain laws of nature invites him instead to put them to his own creative use. The fire within a mountain may create for him an ore, and so the fire in his furnace enables him to transmute it, alloy it, purify it, and render it in the form of a sword. The craftsman directs the laws of nature toward his own designs and creativity. He apprentices himself in this way to the gods. The architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi famously remarked, of a similar mind, that “—I need to produce great ideas, and I believe that if I were commissioned to design a new universe, I would be mad enough to undertake it.”\n \n\nParacelsus tells us that kheiromancy, despite the literal meaning of the name, is not a way of thinking to be shackled strictly to the hand. Modern scholars, in a somewhat wry and altogether unintentional demonstration of their myopic disposition, have even gone so far as to call Paracelsus’s ideas about kheiromancy ‘unique’ and ‘strange.’ And yet, recall that there are many Vedic shastras, or schools of reading lineaments in the body—only one of which deals with those in the hand. Other shastras exist for reading lines in the face, in the feet, and indeed marks of all types and sorts on the body. Each is given over to its own peculiar form of study to differing degrees. According to Paracelsus, there exist natural ‘kheiromancies’ as well. He casts some doubt on whether or not study of the lines in the ‘hands’ of plants—that is, study of the lineaments in leaves—may provide some understanding of a given herb’s medicinal properties, indicating that such a thought was perhaps common in Germany at that time. For his part, not dissimilar to Aristotle’s passing remark that lines in the palm indicate length of life, Paracelsus states that only age can be determined by regard of the herbological lineaments. Any child can count tree rings.\n \n\nGeomantic lineaments, however, are much more similar to the hand. Paracelsus points out, rather ingeniously, a thing which one can easily imagine the Egyptians having relayed to the Greeks who re-learned from them the craft of masonry following the Bronze-Age collapse: That to build monumentally, a tremendous expertise in reading the quarry’s natural fissures and faults is required. Taking the development of the Doric temple, for example, we understand that proportion was not only an aesthetic expression, but more importantly, was a construction methodology. \n \n\nThe Greeks, as I have explained elsewhere, did not compose architectural drawings in order to design. Rather, given several parameters, the temple followed-on proportionally, as construction proceeded, according to an established process of measuring the subsequent components of the temple according to preceding components. Thus, it becomes clear that the order in which stones were able to be cut from the quarry was of critical importance, and often would not align perfectly with construction—especially given the fact that most temples were built from local quarries, of comparatively poor and rural quality stone, where transportation costs would have been easily prohibitive, in the event the quarry become unable to provide a necessary element. The ability of a foreman, then, to ‘read’ the fissures in a quarry, as the workers went, and to map out which areas would be able to yield larger single-piece blocks for the most structurally critical components—the architrave elements for example—was essential to the architectural procedure. The aside should go some way toward illustrating that “kheiromancy” ought to be more rightly thought-of as a much broader, much more fundamental magical idea that enjoyed a complex interlocking of both spiritual and practical purposes.\n \n\nSimilarly, consider the metallurgical mysteries. Take the following passage from Paracelsus:\n\n​\n\n“… by means of chiromancy all minerals and metallic bodies of mines, which lie hid in secret places of the earth, may be known from their external signs. That is the chiromancy of mines, veins, lodes, by which not only those things which are hidden within are brought forth, but also the exact depth and richness of the mine and yield of metal are made manifest.”\n\n \n\nWhat follows is a fantastically detailed description of the practical uses of metallurgical kheiromancy—discussing the specific meanings of coruscations and their colorations, and what is to be gleaned by them in terms of the delvers’ ability to follow, locate, or expose veins of precious minerals.\n   \n\nSo we can see that the ideas that form the basis of kheiromancy surely approach us through the most remote mists of time, regardless of the youth of any one particular system for doing-so. Among them perhaps, are that lineaments of all-kinds are arranged according to some definite rationale. That study of the rationale can allow an observer to acquire hidden knowledge. That the depth, length, and orientation of those marks contain, at the very least, some information about the age or health. \n \n\nThe conclusion, therefore, that the lines in man’s hand are of specific importance is not so difficult a thing at which to arrive. Of all the lines of the body, be they wrinkles in the face, creases in the joints, etc, all intensify with age or over time. Indeed many ancient authors address with passing scorn the suggestion, that the lines in our palms occur as a result of their folding. The lines in the hand, they explain, are unique among all the marks on the body. They are present in an infant at the moment of birth, and even cursory consideration will reveal countless lines emerging from the palms and fingers that have nothing to do with their folding motion—frequently contravening it. What’s more, our hands all fold with the same motion, they reason, so why would so much variation be expected in the seals from one person to another? So the prevailing sentiment was, that the lines are present first, and our hands fold along those already-existing incisions, because it’s given to do so. \n \n\nWhereas other lines appeared as a function of time, the lines in the hand appear to express some fundamental or intrinsic aspect of the person to which they belong. That is the essential reason for why man of antiquity assigned special significance to them. It must have seemed no coincidence to such observers that the ‘seals,’ as they have been called, were placed upon the hand; the instrument which separates man from all other creatures; which enables him to interact in a unique way with his surroundings. His hands, which contain within them the proportions of his body, just as the body contains within itself the proportions of the cosmos. Just as no two men are the same, nor are one pair of hands the same as any other—even twins, born under almost exactly the same celestial circumstances have something about their individual destinies indicated by the marks in their palms—the instruments of their own personal influence and affectation. We will revisit the issue of fate before long.\n \n\nThose fundamental ideas, preserved as they are in the language of the Pontic-Caspian peoples, must have emerged from the age which Howard fictionalized with the phrase “before the coming of the sons of Aryas.” It was after all, as Olcott points out, the Akkadians—or ‘highlanders’ in the mountains northeast of the Babylonians—to whom the mapping of our zodiacal figures across the lineaments in the sky can at least be traced, earlier than the 4th millennium BCE. As man’s ability to take clear stock of his environment is most surely antediluvian, so too must be, in a much broader sense, the roots of any systematic approach to the apparent order of man’s first interest: The formal relation between himself and the world. \n \n\nWhat can be said of the actual practice of fortune-telling with the hands? Divination is a fraught subject. Anyone with more than a passing interest in the matter will inevitably ask the question: What sorts of issues did the ancients believe were conducive to prophecy, and what sorts of issues were not? When Juvenal ridiculed the gypsies in the Roman forum for swindling housewives promising them granular, materialistic knowledge about the specific date of their impending divorce, how would that have been differentiated from the work of Hadrian’s venerable grandfather? \n \n\nClearly, for all peoples who incorporated sober study of symbolism into their way of life, there must have been patterns of thought for differentiating heretic from hierophant. The ancients, as well, of course can hardly be treated as a monolithic object; as a single tradition projected from one unified mind. Ptolemy and Cicero both demonstrate a rather degenerated and materialistic view of the role and capacity of the divinatory arts—Ptolemy doing-so in praise of it, and Cicero for his part in polemicizing it. Both characterize the arts of prognostication as hyper-specified. They are things which either can, or are paraded as-if, they have the ability to foretell a seemingly endless degree of true, material certainties about the future, and which are limited only by the ability and breadth-of-scope of a given practitioner. In truth, such a ‘scientized’ outlook of divination, again, regardless of the profferer’s excitement or skepticism with respect to the view at hand, only indicates that the age or place in which it flourishes is one of noteworthy decadence. \n \n\nThat is not to wave-away Cicero’s eloquent criticism of Quintus’s stoic apologetics. It is, rather, to say that modern academics are overly keen to apply Cicero’s mentality to all divination in all eras, as opposed to applying it only to the specific charlatans with which Cicero and his contemporaries must have been assaulted on a daily basis. In other words, when the streets are full of gypsies who have one hand on your shoulder and the other hand in your pocket, a certain type of criticism is the natural and just response. To apply the same criticism to the patriarch of the imperial family, whose hands remain folded behind his back, however, is naive at best and disingenuous at worst.\n \n\nFor this specific reason are prophecy and catastrophe married in all of the world’s most erudite and carefully guarded traditions. The curse of Cassandra, as that marriage was known to the Greeks, is seen reflected to some degree as well in the old Irish geisa; those esoteric impositions or curses laid on one by another, infraction against-which would consequently bring about calamity. \n \n\nWith the kheiromant, or any diviner for that matter, it must have been crucial to develop and maintain a clear understanding of two concepts. The first we might simply call the ‘way,’ referring to the specific ways in which things tend to unfold—as Heraclitus explained, stones tend to fall to the earth and water tends to flow back to the sea. Ptolemy concisely directs his readers to observe the way in which the stars signal the cyclical passage of time, and therefore, prognostication as to the onset of seasons for agricultural work, or as to establishing a bearing at sea are ascertainable by studying the movement and form of the stars. The very act of prophecy is thus revealed to even the most primitive observer, who notes that the coming of the winter season is heralded by certain arrangements in the night sky, long before the weather changes. Even in that simple observation, ancient man was assured that study of an esoteric kind would in fact yield foreknowledge.\n \n\nThe second we might call the ‘will,’ referring to a position broadly held to be self-evident among all pre-industrial cultures in one form or another; that beyond the way in which things unfold, nothing is given to unfold at all without first being caused or imposed according to the designs of some will—be it human or, by extrapolation, divine. It’s this second concept which provided the ancient sages with recourse from a kind-of modernist astrological ‘determinism.’\n \n\nIn one sense, the question is perhaps one of the difference between determinism and destiny. What was encoded in the geometry of a man or woman’s nativity, or, what may be meant by the lineaments incised into his or her hands, comes only in the form of predispositions and propensities, or, said another way, as indicative of the character of obstacles which he or she will tend to find in the course of their own life. That is what was determined. What was destined, however, as far as we employ the term in to make the point, was for them and them alone to decide—as a function of their own agency, or will. It will perhaps be illuminating at this juncture to provide the following passage from Manly P. Hall on the same subject:\n\n \n\n“Realizing that generals are more helpful than particulars, [the astrologer] will not prophesy times and places but will reveal those tendencies which, if left uncorrected, will become the parents of innumerable complications... When studying the stars, the astrologer should never forget that these marching orbs signify the immutability of cosmic law. The prophet many times is but a man who has sufficient confidence in the integrity of life’s plan to dare to rise up and say that the things which we do today will produce tomorrow a harvest of consistent consequences.”"

  "title": "The Present Low State of the Arts in England ...",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/low-state-of-the-arts",
  "content": "Introduction\n\nBy Alexander J. Ford\n\n​\n\nThe following sequence of texts appeared in one of London's premiere publications in the fall of 1815. The first two were published anonymously. Although, it quickly became clear who was responsible--both to the target of the author's criticism, and to the inner circles of architects at the time, who were in a position to surmise. The author was a struggling playwright and actor, who also happened to be the son of one of London's most highly respected architects, historians, classicists, and collectors of antiquities--the venerable John Soane. \n\n​\n\nGeorge, his youngest son, penned the following assault against the quality, and character of his father's work for a variety of reasons, which we will leave to the reader to suss out, if they like. Suffice it to say, history hardly remembers this exchange of embattled prose, and when on rare occasion his name is brought up, George is often presented as a drunken failure, who harbored a great bitterness for his estimable father; as an essential example of the King and his spoiled princeling. However, upon locating (at last) and transcribing these pieces, what emerges to the eyes of the editors, here, is a rather cogent criticism of the neoclassical willingness to reduce the symbolic character of the classics to mere concerns of style. Regardless of his personal character, regardless of the evident intent to wound contained within these writings, it is nevertheless true as well, that the fundamental spirit of the criticism is just, and ought to be heard. The mind that produced these polemical arguments ought not to simply be waved away on account of his apparently caustic disposition, or on account of the familial discord which fomented them. \n\n​\n\nWhen the first article appeared, John Soane quickly discovered it--an avid reader of the papers himself--and was distraught. He knew immediately that it could only have been the work of George, despite the anonymous byline. When his wife, Eliza--who was in poor health at the time--read the paper she proclaimed, \"Those are George's doing. He has given me my death blow. I shall never be able to hold up my head again.\" Eliza Soane passed away in November of 1815. John, grieved by the loss of his beloved wife, blamed George and this specific article for her death. He clipped the full article from the paper, and affixed it to a board, in its entirety, scrawling \"Death Blows Given by George, 10th and 24th Sept. 1815,\" on a placard that swung beneath. This, he nailed to the wall of his drawing room. \n\n​\n\nThat board is contained now within the Soane Museum Archives, and is not often exhibited. Therefore, it is our pleasure to present not only the full text of the initial piece (split into two portions published 10th and 24th September, 1815), but also, a letter of apology addressed to John Soane, composed and printed frantically by the Champion's presiding editor, in the hopes of allaying Mr. Soane's ire that they ran the piece in the first place. Following the editor's word, there was also appended a curt, but moving final letter of apology written by George Soane, though still anonymously, in vain attempt to repair what damage his criticism had caused. \n\n​\n\nThey never reconciled.\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nPart I\n\n \n\nA mercantile spirit is perhaps least of all calculated for the production of any thing great or lasting. The mind, that has for years been employed in the minutiae of traffic, in weighing sugar against plumbs, and reckoning up the yearly interest of accumulated farthings, cannot easily expand itself to the perception of what is really grand; it will measure every thing by its saleable value, or in other words, by its value in exchange for the common necessities of life. It must be quite clear that minds acting upon this principle will have no love either for art or science, for the value of the first as an article of exchange depends entirely upon the variable caprice of fashion, and the influence of the latter in producing the comforts of life is not sufficiently direct for the understanding of men whose conceptions are narrowed by habitat and education. Thus it happens that this country can boast of so few painters, architects, or sculptors to vie with the records of Italy or of remoter times; the people at large neither admire nor understand such occupations, and it naturally follows that genius opens for itself other channels, richer both in fame and profit, leaving these ill-requited pursuits to men of weaker intellect and greater industry. It is indeed true that genius sometimes has so strong a bias to art, that it overlooks these obstacles, and to this we owe the paintings of a LAWRENCE, and an OWEN, the sculpture of a BANKS, and the architecture of a SMIRKE; but these names are by no means sufficient to justify the reproaches cast upon the nation by every foreigner who has visited us—they laugh at the heavy, lumbering extravagance of the bank and the fooleries of NASH, over Chinese pagodas and our drawing-rooms built after the fashion of Grecian architecture, it yet does not follow that our parlors and bed-rooms are to be modeled after the plan of a heathen temple—because the taste of Athens designed the figures called Caryatides, it surely is not requisite that ladies of stone are to be grinning at full length in the front of a substantial, brick-built modern house—it is like decorating a harlequin with a Roman helmet. Yet all these, and greater incongruities, are to be found in the capital of England; and indeed there are scarcely six buildings in the whole town that merit the attention of a moment. In the greater part of the streets every building is at variance in fashion from his neighbors; one gigantic house erects his tall head to the fifth story, while his more modest neighbor shrinks into a third. Sometimes the buildings in a street are seen by twos and threes, leaving vacant open spaces like the straggling teeth in an old woman’s head; and sometimes they look of all sorts, colors, and sizes like [illegible] at the first muster.\n\n \n\nThe minds of the titled and opulent English families seem progressively to have withered into dwarfishness, superficial in their acquirements, without any firmness of character or expansion of intellect, they live only for frivolity; it is true they pretend to admire painting, but it is only pretence; they do not understand, and therefore can feel no real admiration. They stare at pictures with the same sort of intelligence that children gaze at highly-coloured prints; they are pleased with the blaze of colours, and having picked up a few terms of art, which they do not comprehend, and if they did, could not rightly apply, they ogle with their glasses and prattle away with all the ease of understanding, and all the impudence of ignorance.\n\n \n\nNeglected by the higher orders, and which is of far more importance, by the middling class of people, in whom almost all the intelligence of the nation is to be found, it is by no means surprising that the Arts have sunk in this country to so low an ebb. Indulgence and neglect are as powerful agents in corrupting the vigour of the mind, as luxury and indulgence, and unless it were possible to change the general feelings of the nation it is useless to expect any pre-eminence in Art. This low state of Art is more particularly disgraceful, when we reflect upon the enormous sums lavished in the extravagance and dissipation of our Court. The price of one night’s luxury would be a year’s maintenance to an artist, the thousands squandered in the trumperies of a sham fight, and the more laughable trumperies of a pagoda, would suffer to build a noble monument of the genius of the British people. This would be an honour to the present race and ensure them the grateful admiration of posterity; while the festival, before alluded to, only opened an occasion for the most profligate debauchery, which brought with it disgrace at the time, and has left behind it a canker of dissipation, which no after-remedies will be able to destroy. It was no better than an invitation to idleness and debauchery; it rendered the people familiar with a profligacy of every kind; drunkenness and open prostitution were the order of the day.  The courtly defenders had the sagacity to find all this deserving of the highest praise; they, who upon other occasions declared the people were mere ciphers in the general account, now thought proper to consider them deserving of every attention; “they ought to be amused, poor souls”—as if debauchery was the only amusement their fancies could invent; as if an idle [illegible]-show, erected at a most enormous expense, was the proper mode of rewarding people for the privations of a long and cruel warfare. How does it happen that the defenders of courtly prerogative, should almost always be its bitterest enemies? Without wasting more time in vain regret for the past which cannot well be recalled, let us consider the expensive works lately erected in this metropolis, and some at the public expense. To begin with the Chelsea Hospital. Within the last two years, a new Infirmary, new stables, and a new house for the use of the clerk of the works, have been erected. Without pretending to any very great skill in architecture, it must be quite clear, that buildings so different of construction; the case is precisely the reverse;—not that we mean to say there is a manger in the architect’s house, or a drawing room in the stables, but the style of architecture is the same in all, the house being rather the most awkward of the three; on the top at the back are two large raisin jars, fresh, to all appearance, from the grocer’s shop. Fronting them, ranged in military array, appears a little regiment of chimney-pots with white heads, like so many well-grown cauliflowers; the house has two wings, one of which has windows, and the other a door, which might almost induce the belief, that after the whole was just completed, it was found that the very essential article—a door, had been forgotten; though after all it might as well have been omitted; one of those numerous cauliflower chimneys might have been spared by way of entrance, and a ladder, after the manner of Robinson Crusoe, might have been used for the purpose of gaining admission.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nPart II\n\n \n\nIf the house appropriated to the Clerk of the works is a monster in the art of building, the Infirmary belonging to the same Hospital is not a jot behind it in absurdity. Heaviness and frivolity are there most delightfully blended, the mass of the building is dull and cumbersome, while all the ornaments are of the most light and trifling kind. There is something exquisitely ludicrous in this unison of contrarieties, the effect of which is hardly to be conveyed in writing. Disproportion is the most striking feature in the works of this artist; he plunders from the records of antiquity things in themselves absolutely good, but which never were intended to meet in the same place. Thus in the Bank of England, the greatest part of which is built by Mr. SOANE, we meet with remnants of mausoleums, caryatides, pillars from temples, ornaments from the Pantheon, and all heaped together with a perversion of taste that is truly admirable. He steals a bit here, and a bit there, and in piling up these collected thefts, he imagines he has done the duty and earned the honours of an artist.\n\n \n\nDepraved as is the present taste, such follies will not pass for wisdom, the public laugh at those extravagancies, which are too dull for madness, and too mad for the soberness of reason. The most extraordinary instance of this perversity of taste and dullness of invention is to be found in this artist’s house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The exterior, from exceeding heaviness and monumental gloom, seems as if it were intended to convey a satire upon himself; it looks like a mound of the departed, and can only mean, that considering himself as defunct in that better part of humanity—the mind and its affections—he has reared this mausoleum for the enshrinement of his body.\n\n \n\nThe interior of this building forms a ludicrous contrast with its external appearance. The passages glow with the deepest red: the lower room, which occupies the whole length of the building, is converted into a library, a second satire upon the possessor, who must stand in the midst of these hoarded volumes like a eunuch in a seraglio; the envious and impining guardian of that which he cannot enjoy. On the left is a small room intended for a study, and beyond is a narrow lofty cave, [illegible] the museum; it is lighted at the top by a lantern of stained glass, forming a strange medley of Gothic and Grecian taste. Its contents, in a moral point of view, are truly valuable; here are urns that once contained the ashes of the great, the wise, and the good; here are relics broken from the holy temples of Greece and Italy; here is the image of Ephesian Diana, once the object of human adoration, but now only valued as to rarity, that by its prior may feel the groveling pride of its possessor. We are not architects, nor do we pretend to more knowledge in the art than common observation can supply, but we aspire, however unworthily, to that higher character which unites moral feeling with those inanimate objects, and does not basely admire a column because its proportions may be just or its marble may be pure. Somerset House and St. Paul’s are too well known to need discussion; but the merits of Convent-Garden Theatre have not yet been fully appreciated. The entire appearance of this building is grand and imposing; there is a unity, a harmony about the whole, which adds a considerable weight to its magnificence. Nothing can excel the effect of the Pit entrance by lamp-light; it is an illusion that borders on fairy-land; the play of light and shadow upon the arches produces a feeling of mystery and extent, that must be felt to be rightly understood. Beautiful as this building is in its external relations, we certainly object to that part allotted to the audience. The contraction of the sides, near the proscenium, of course contracts the view of the stage, and compels the actor either to advance to the middle, or remain unseen by those that are nearest to him. On this account the circular form seems preferable; the actor is then distinctly seen from all parts of the house; the apparent size of the stage is considerably increased, thus in a great degree uniting the opposite advantages of a small and extended Theatre. It is true that the form of this pile is best calculated to hold a multitude of people, and therefore is most agreeable to managerial taste, but with this we have no concern; it is a situation altogether foreign to our purpose; we only consider it in that shape, which shall be most agreeable to they of taste, and at the same time most adequate to the purpose of the drama. With this reservation it is a noble building, creditable to the architect, and his country that enjoys it.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nFrom, THE FINE ARTS, section 12th November, 1815 issue:\n\n \n\nMr. Soane,\n\n \n\nIn giving publicity to the following very requisite apology for an attack made on Mr. Soane in this Paper, the Editor of the Champion deems it necessary to mention, that he has seen, with equal dissatisfaction and regret, several other attacks on individuals, couched in objectionable language, which found their way into his Journal during his late absence. To the individuals so improperly treated, an apology is not the less due because they have not thought it necessary to complain. As we are the determined maintainers of the right of criticism, we are proportionably sorry when we see it confounded with mere abuse. When we use this word we are of course aware of its misconstructions and perversions—but we give fair notice that we surrender nothing to the claims of a sensitive selfishness, or a consciousness of impropriety. Ridicule or serious remonstrance, as the case may require, must still be applied, and sharply applied, to the follies or the vices that come in contact with the public interests;—and we use the latter word in its most extensive sense, as including every thing correct in taste as well as sound in morals, every thing elegant, as well as every thing useful, in enjoyment and possession. We make no concession whatever to the bouncings of irritated pride,—we cannot ever stop our hand in the view of the writhings of agonised vanity. We are at times, it is true, out of humour with our vocations,—for it is not quite the fact that “no creature smarts so little as a fool,”—but we would rather drop it than its integrity.\n\n \n\nThis much it was necessary to say, that we might not be mistaken, and that it might not get abroad that the Champion for the future meant to deal only in the style of dedications;— but attacks evidently leveled against those points of an individual’s character with which the public have little or no concern, or originating solely in private resentment, of the justice of which the public can be no judge,—although they may find a [illegible] in the semblance of criticism on professional merits, are always dishonorable, and therefore recoil injuriously on those by whom they are made. It is in this conviction that we deemed an apology due to Mr. Soane, and to others; and the gentleman who committed the error, has, on reflection, felt the propriety of offering a public apology to Mr. Soane. Under the circumstances which we have stated, and dissenting also from several of the points of opinion broached in some late Numbers of the Champion, the Editor thinks it necessary to announce, that he withdrew from superintendence of this Journal some days before No. 138 was published, and returned to edit No. 146. In regard to the Nos. from 138 to 145, inclusive, therefore, his readers will have the goodness to consider him responsible only for those articles in them which may be signed, as this,\n\n \n\ned.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE CHAMPION\n\n \n\nSir,—In some observations on the Present state of the Fine Arts, and particularly of Architecture, published in your paper a few weeks ago, I expressed some criticisms on the buildings at the Chelsea Hospital, and on the works of Mr. Soane, which, as being the result of misconception, I deeply regret to have written. There are moments in the lives of most men, when excited feelings take erroneous views of surrounding circumstances; and, finding myself in error, I am anxious to acknowledge that error. To say more would be offensive to his delicacy,—to have said less, would be unsatisfactory to myself. But having unjustly wounded the feelings of a distinguished artist, I consider myself bound in honour, to heal, as far as lies in my power the wounds inflicted by the intemperance of resentment.—All that I regret is, that, though I have the inclination, I have not the power to offer this gentleman that reparation which his merits are entitled to.\n\n \n\n-The Writer of the Essays on Fine Arts, contained\n\nin the Champion of the 10th and 24th of September, 1815."

  "content": "Origins of Sabazios\n\n \n\nAncient authors inform us that the cult of Sabazios was well-known in Thrace from an early date. Although, the paucity of physical evidence for that claim led academic consensus to assume for a time, that those accounts were mistaken. What archaeological evidence for the cult does exist is of Hellenistic, or Roman origination; it comes later, and in the form of complex votive hands—often cast in bronze, and lavishly ornamented with all manner of mystifying symbols. Beyond that, there is sparse relief, and arguments drawn from the texts.\n\n \n\nWhat’s well-known is that those later cults in Attica and Rome were viewed as foreign in character; they were imported into the metropolitan environment from elsewhere, and therefore, we might say perhaps provided form to a reactionary force in those places—which for one reason or another, assumed the vestments of the mysterious Sabazia. For decades modern scholars tended to consider Sabazios to be of exclusively Phrygian origin. The Thracian root was contentious. According to the rationale, the cult was introduced then, from Phrygia into mainland Greece later, and thereafter into Rome. A competing theory, though one that’s since lost credence, is that the cult’s origin was Semitic, and must have been absorbed by syncretic mechanism into the Greco-Roman zeitgeist. We’ll examine that strange hypothesis briefly, for the simple reason that in some circles it still inexplicably persists. Cornelius Hispalus is recorded to have ordered the exclusion of several groups from Rome in 139 BC, in the following edict:\n\n \n\nCn. Cornelius Hispalus praetor peregrinus, M. Popilio Laenate, L. Calpurnio consulibus, edicto Chaldaeos citra decimum diem abire ex urbe atque Italia iussit, levibus et ineptis ingeniis fallaci siderum interpretatione quaestuosam mendaciis suis caliginem inicientes. Idem ludaeos, qui Sabazi lovis cultu Romanos inficere mores conati erant, repetere domos suas coegit.\n\n \n\n\"Gnaeus Cornelius Hispalus, praetor peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Popilius Laenas and Lucius Calpurnius, ordered the Chaldeans by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within ten days, since by a fallacious interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their lies. The same praetor [also] compelled the Jews, who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius, to return to their homes.\"\n\n \n\nThe above passage is often supplied as the source of the misconception that Sabazios was perhaps a god of Semitic origin, rather than Phrygian or Thracian origin. Later authors pointed out, however, that the passage in question is, itself, reproduced from an epitome of an original volume by Valerius Maximus, which was lost. That is to say, that what survives was copied and summarized after the fact, and that the author of this passage may have conflated two items mentioned separately in the original, by mistake: The one being the expulsion of the Sabazios cult from the city, and the other being the expulsion of the Jews from the city. Both groups were expelled simultaneously, but individually, by one edict. The resulting notion of a Hebrew cult of Sabazios would in this case be a mistake of translation and interpretation. There is, however, another line of thought as-to how Sabazios became erroneously connected to contemporary Hebrew cult practice.\n\n​\n\nEarly on in his 1913 volume devoted to survey of the Dioskouroi, J. Rendel Harris makes an ingenious observation (relegated to a footnote) on the subject of the Zebedee-Stone; that the name \"Zebedee,\" which is often confusing to Biblical Scholars, may actually be a syncretic formation of the Phrygian Zeus: Sabazios. Rather than paraphrase his thesis, we will reproduce the relevant portions of that footnote here:\n\n​\n\n\"Of non-Semitic influence in Galilee, ... the only possible direction would be the name of the Phrygian Zeus, which the Greeks give as Sabazios, Sabadios, and a variety of similar spellings. Usener traces the root of this name to the word storm, which would make Sabazios originally a storm god. His cult can be traced as far east as Cilicia and Cappadocia; and in the west he follows the Roman armies with Mithra. I know, however, of no trace of him in Syria or Northern Palestine. In his cult-monuments we sometimes find depicted the Eagle and the Lightning, and the Oakbranch. ... it might be suggested that the awkward and unnatural expression 'the mother of Zebedee's children,' which occurs twice in the Gospel of Matthew, would be perfectly lucid, if Zebedee's children were equivalent to the Dioscuri, or Zeus' boys.\"\n\n​\n\nIt appears that the Phrygian eye saw in the 'Bacchic' rites of the Hebrews of that area, practices most identifiable with the orgiastic rites of a god familiar to them—Sabazios. It's a syncretic process, then, that we see unfolding, for example, in Plutarch's similar assessment that the Jews worshipped Dionysus (often identified and conflated with Sabazios). In his Quaestiones Convivales, 6.2, Plutarch writes of the Hebrews that \"the time and manner of their greatest and most holy solemnity is exactly agreeable to the holy rites of Bacchus.\" He goes on to add that hat their holy day was comparable to a festival of Sabazios, writing \"that their Sabbaths have some relation to Bacchus; for even at this day many call the Bacchi by the name of Sabbi, and they make use of that word at the celebration of Bacchus's orgies.\" \n\n \n\nIn light of all this this we ought to lay aside (at last) the strange idea that Sabazios was, himself, a god of Semitic origin, in favor of what seems to be a far more sensible picture. Not that Sabazios was picked up from the Hebrews by syncretic mechanism, but rather that the Hebrews were viewed, themselves, in syncretic terms by Indo-European onlookers. As we will see in short order, Sabazios is a figure deeply rooted in the Indo-European tradition, is in fact a storm deity who shares a profusion of symbolic associations with other Indo-European storm gods including the Eagle, Serpent, Fulmen, and relation to the Horse Twins, and whose mystery cult survived in Thrace, in Rome, and in Phrygia until late enough that the practices of the Hebrews in the East could stand be made sense-of, at all, through comparison to the mysterious Sabazia.\n\n \n\nAside from the matter of origin, very little work has been done toward deciphering the intent of the symbols, present on the votive hands. That is the task we set for ourselves here—at least, the major fixtures. Namely, the form of the gesture itself, the eagle and/or fulmen atop the upright digits, and the drake or serpent atop the downturned digits. The pinecone or yew ‘berry’ over the thumb will figure in to a later study, concerning the thumb itself. While there is considerable overlap in the iconography from one hand to another, from one cult to another—which suggests a deeply held, and rigorous symbolic rationale—these particular adornments appear to be essential, and are present on nearly every example. Before we scrutinize the votive hands, however, some effort ought to be spared toward the question of Thracian or Phrygian source, and toward the character of Sabazios himself. As we will see, he was certainly known to both the Phrygians and the Thracians, and therefore, was most likely carried into both of those regions by the common ancestral culture(s) earlier in history, responsible for siring them both. If that were the case, we would expect to see significant overlap between Sabazios, his cult and iconography, and well-established archetypes of the Proto-Indo-European religion. Naturally, we do.\n\n \n\nIt’s hard to justify ignoring the structure of a word or of a name, especially when the object is to interrogate the esoteric intentions of an otherwise hidden subject. Such things are never arbitrary for the ancients, are often idiomatic the further back we can discern their roots, and are seldom categorical. Understanding the literal meaning of a word or a name is invaluable, then, because it reveals what things the ancients who employed those words used, to stand-in for the concepts or ideas they were naming. All are, to some degree, analogies.\n\n \n\nThus our inquiry begins with the name itself, Σαβάζιος. There is no accepted etymology for this configuration. As well, the name has enjoyed innumerable transliterations across time—owing no doubt to the popularity of the Sabazian mysteries. For the Romans, it was formed as Sebazius, or Sebadius. In the original Greek there are several alternative forms beyond Σαβάζιος, one being (transliterated) Savadios or Sava-(th)eos, another is nearer to Sa'azios. What we notice immediately is that all of the secondary phonemes are cognate with that of Zeus; Dyeus, Theos, or Deus. “Zeus Sabazios” then, as he was known to the Greeks can perhaps be recognized as a tautological form: Zeus Saba-zeus. In other words, Sabazios appears to have been periodically reincorporated by the Greeks, later, as a version or versions of Zeus.\n\n \n\nWe turn our attention to the preceding root, then. A passage in Demosthenes describes the ritual cry of Sabazian initiates:\n\n \n\n\"In day-time you marshalled your gallant throng of bacchanals through the public streets, their heads garlanded with fennel and white poplar; and, as you went, you squeezed the fat-cheeked snakes, or brandished them above your head, now shouting your Euoi Saboi!\"\n\n \n\nThe chanted word Saboi is surely related to the name Sabazios, though little is accepted beyond that it’s a foreign word, and of Thracian source. In the rest, Seba, Sava, Saua, Sa’a, we find that scholars tentatively suggest the source to be two-fold. First a Proto-Indo-European root meaning, ‘to take liquid', whence the English word sup, and second, an ending construction from that same tongue, meaning literally 'that which waters [the ground]'. Another related branch on this tree worth drawing into the confluence is the Ancient Greek Σάος, meaning something like ‘safe’ in the sense of alive.\n\n \n\nPerhaps in light of all this, the name Sabazios could be rendered, ‘Deus, the pourer of libations,’ or ‘Deus, who waters.’ In a forthcoming column dealing with the mystical connections between the thumb, the libation, and the spondee for the Greeks, we will clarify this aspect of the sky-father archetype, although to manage the focus at-present we’ll restrict our comment only to this: There flows a river called \"saoua\" or \"sava\" in Thrace, and although it’s difficult to say if there is any categorical relation between the two, it should be noted that similar structures are being employed nevertheless.\n\n \n\nTo clarify, then, it appears that Sabazios came down broadly from the north in successive migrations with those Pontic Caspian peoples in one form or another, and was known to them as an iteration of the sky-father. The cult of Sabazios then, if it was at that time in a recognizable form, likely split around the Aegean, as they did, to follow the waterways either into Thrace in the west, or into Anatolia in the east. It’s the eastern branch which is attested earlier, in the material record, and gave rise to the attitude among scholars that Sabazios somehow sprang into existence among the Phrygians, and that the authors of antiquity who noted his Thracian presence as well were mistaken; that his obvious position in the continuum of Proto-Indo-European cultures was something at which to frown. But bear in mind, as if to agree with the picture we’ve just illustrated, that Herodotus tells us the Phrygians themselves originally lived in the Balkans. From both sources, at different times, then came versions of that forerunner-god into Greece, until finally we see a degenerated cult of Sabazios re-establish itself in metropolitan 5th century Athens, recognized again to be Zeus, and so provided the epithet Zeus Sabazios.\n\n \n\nIn 2011, Professor Nikolay Ovcharov of the New Bulgarian University, and the Slavic University in Moscow presented finds from his excavations at the Thracian site Perperikon in modern-day Bulgaria. Episodes detailing a famous temple to Sabazios appear in the writings of Herodotus, and those of Suetonius; both accounts as we’ve said were long-considered to be incorrect by consensus. Nevertheless, that temple now seems to have entered the material record at last. Note that the Greeks typically identified the later, foreign cult of Sabazios with the more familiar cult of Dionysos, on account of the similarity of their orgiastic rites.\n\n \n\nFirst, a relevant passage from Suetonius on the subject:\n\n \n\n\"...When Octavian, father of Augustus, at the head of his army, came upon the Holy Mount of Dionysus, he consulted the oracle about his son, and the prophets said to him that his son was to rule the world, for as the wine was spilt onto the altar, the smoke rose up above the top of the shrine and even unto heavens, as had happened when Alexander the Great himself had sacrificed upon that same altar\".\n\n \n\nAnd an excerpt from a report on the field work of Prof. Ovchavov:\n\n \n\n“The latest finds are from a sanctuary in the Thracian settlement which Prof. Ovchavov considers may have links with the sanctuary on the acropolis. On the basis of the finds from recent excavations Prof. Ovchavov believes that he has discovered the Thracian temple of Dionysos mentioned by ancient writers such as Herodotus and Suetonius, but not so far located. The temple was famed in the ancient world, and was a major sanctuary, but its location remains a mystery. The local deity called Sabazios, came to be associated with the Greek god Dionysos over time. The sanctuary was a oracular shrine due to this particular aspect of Sabazios. A representation of Sabazios may be seen on an ivory from the tomb of Alexander IV at Vergina, perhaps because of the time spent by Roxane and Alexander IV in Thrace.”\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nRight Handedness\n\n \n\nOf the votive Sabazian hands themselves, we notice first that all are right hands—none left. The idea that the right hand is a ‘healing’ hand, or in other words its association with healing arts and traditions is quite common. In previous work I have elucidated the healing aspects of the Hyperborean sky-father deities, if you will. To summarize the Greek mentality as it’s relevant here—an open right hand was, broadly, a healing gesture. A closed right hand, or, the left hand was the opposite—a symbol of imparting wounds, or disaster. While there’s a clear correspondence between physical handedness, and the notion of one sacred and the other profane, there’s also a connection between the healing/wounding hands of the god, and the dioskouroi—the Indo-European horse-twins, one of whom was, of legend, a healer, and the other a warrior. We find several depictions of Sabazios in relief, in which he is accompanied by the dioskouroi as well as a serpent and an eagle, often riding a horse himself and carrying a spear.\n\n \n\nThe Greek notion of right-handedness is well-developed and lent to the epithet—hyperdexios, or beyond the right hand. Zeus, Apollo, and Athena all were provided this epithet at one time or another. Hunting for the root word of dexios to gain a clearer sense of the meaning of that term, we find a philologist called Stuber who suggests that the origin is the Proto-Indo-European construction dekos (that which is proper) from dek- (to take or perceive). Curiously, following on through derivations of dekos, we find endless words descended therefrom, in multiple Indo-European tongues, which cover meanings like honor, pride, worship, veneration, offering, and so on and so forth. From the root dek- we find derivatives spanning meanings like order, arrangement, worship, honor, reverence, attendance, dedication, etc.\n\n \n\nAll of which is to say, that these sacred ideas appear to have all in-turn been associated idiomatically with the notion of right-handedness.\n\n \n\nThere is no specific word for the left hand evidenced in the Proto-Indo-European; only the right. Anatoly Lieberman has studied the linguistic roots of the notions of rightwardness and leftwardness. He notes that both words in their Latin forms, dexter and sinister, contain a suffix denoting the comparison of degrees, though the meaning is murky. Surveying Indo-European words for left, one finds applied connotations of awkwardness, bent or crookedness, deficiency, crippling, lameness, weakness, worthlessness, and so on. Upon reflection, however, it isn’t particularly difficult to understand why the ancients would ascribe deficiency or weakness to the left hand (or side). The simple fact is that most people are right-handed. Most people can feel, for themselves, the comparative weakness in trying to use their left hand to perform the same functions as their right. There is even an arguably ‘ambient’ weakness one can feel in the non-dominant hand by taking a moment to simply be cognizant of it. It’s not that weakness is associated with the left, it’s that the left is self-evidently weak. Hence, left-handed people are called corky-handed, not because they’re deficient themselves, but simply because they are predisposed to making use of the hand which the vast majority finds to be the weaker. They’re weak-handed, in name, not in value.\n\n \n\nIt’s been pointed out as well, that orienting the right hand or healing hand toward the newborn sun means one faces north, toward the celestial center. And, therefore the left hand or wounding hand lies in the west with the passage of the sun into the underworld. This is likely the reason for why “Occident” or West, comes from the Latin meaning to fall, to set, or to die. Occidere was a word employed for grief and ruin. One is reminded of the profusion of myths in the Indo-European corpus that locates the land of the dead beyond the western horizon. It would surely not have been lost on man of antiquity that facing the center of the great wheel aligned his hands to the apparent nature of the diurnal heirophany.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nThe Benediction\n\n \n\nThe particular gesture formed by the hand of Sabazios is common to a variety of traditions in history. Evidenced at least so early as the proto-Thracian mysteries of Sabazios, the gesture came to be called the benedictio (literally “the good word”) and often occupies the hands of Christ in Christian iconography. It’s been applied as both a healing gesture to numerous deities, as well as employed as an oratory gesture by man and god alike. Previously I have discussed the connection between oration and healing magic, through the symbolism of the forefinger specifically. What’s important to recall is that the chant, or spoken word, is deeply entwined with the sense we have of a Hyperborean, Jupiterian healing cult—focused as it was, on the agnatic nature of the blood-inside; the patrilineal line ending ultimately in Jove himself. It’s in this context that we can situate Sabazios as another, albeit Thracio-Phrygian, incarnation of that particular mode of Dyeus Patir.\n\n \n\nWe will restrain our survey of the benediction to its most general aspects, for the simple reason that more detailed studies of the features of the hand must be offered before describing the way the gesture effects those features. All ancient kheiromantic practices hold the thumb apart from the four fingers or digits, considering it to be a separate entity, so to speak. In light of this we can view the orientation of the four dactyls as split equally down the center of the palm in-line with the arm, two apportioned upward toward the heavens; the first and second finger or Jovial and Saturnine respectively, and two appointed downward toward the chthonic realms; the third and fourth fingers, or the Solar and Mercurial respectively. What’s at work here, then, in the most elementary sense, is the esoteric doctrine of consequence rendered in terms of the hand. It would perhaps be as-correct to view a symbolic representation of the gates of Cancer and Capricorn in the gesture, as it would be to equate it to the chalice and the pinnacle: An even division, signifying the higher and lower realms.\n\n \n\nLeft extended, then, are the first and second fingers, together with the thumb—either at it’s natural angle splayed away from the palm, or in some instances, held gently pressed alongside the palm in-line with the fingers or held upright and isolated, it makes no apparent difference. It is not by chance that these three together represent the agnatic line in the kheiromantic tradition: Kronos, the grandfather, Zeus, the father, and the Self—the son—the will, or eros in the most ancient sense. Thus the benedictio demonstrates the underlying patrilineal blood-principle of the healing art, while at the same time holding the thumb apart from the higher and lower planes; either literally, or by nature of its kheiromantic association alone.\n\n​\n\nThere is the Mercurial matter, as well. The vast majority of the votive Sabazian hands include fixtures at the wrist (nail holes, etc.), which allowed them to be attached to the top of a staff and carried in ritual procession. Recall that Sabazios was often identified with Dionysus, who as well, carried the sacred thyrsus staff, topped with a pine cone or yew berry. The essential reasoning for this is somewhat evident. It's been pointed out by numerous authors that the benedictio seems to be an 'oratory' gesture, and carry a connotation of instruction, teaching, or mastery in one form or another. Consider the Mercurial staff in-tandem. It's quite common for the psychopomp figure to carry just such an item. Mercury is frequently depicted with the benedictio occupying his hands as well. In other words, the nature of initiation for any given mystery cult is the acquiring of divine gnosis. The same gnosis one acquires on death; which in fact defines death—no different from that gained by the alchemist, seeking the symbolic passage—the ego death, at work in his tower. So the priests of antiquity ascended the Ziggurat in imitation of their soul's ascent back into the realm of the divine. It's no surprise that the Sabazia would contain a concoction of all these symbols—the gesture of a teacher, affixed to a staff, shepherding as they did, their initiates to some 'higher' knowledge. The priest assumes the role of the psychopomp, then, and the benedictio—the Indo-European doctrine of vitality writ in-terms of the hand—persists throughout history.\n\n \n\nSome scholars have noted in appraising the iconography of the benedictio that the entire forearm seems to be important to the gesture in some cases. We would be remiss not to observe, too, that it's important for the second finger to remain extended—for the most important metric, or rule, of the human body is the cubit; measured from the elbow to the tip of the longest, or Saturnine finger. Thus, presenting the benedictio is often synonymous with presenting the human  ‘ἀναλογία’ (analogia). In the interest of convenience, and in order not to belabor the point, we'll remind the reader in-passing that a prior article (Architectural Symbolism of the Scepter, Edition 3), treats this issue in more detail. \n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nFulmen, and Serpent\n\n \n\nCommonly situated atop the extended first and second fingers on the Hand of Sabazios, there is placed a symbolic fulmen—occasionally gripped, as well, by a pair of eagle’s talons. One hardly needs to point out that the bolt and eagle are identified with Jove, but what does merit our attention is the relation between the fulmen; the spear, and the form of the gesture itself. It’s been noted in-passing by other observers that the Thracian horsemen were well-known for making use of a particular tool for increasing leverage over spear-throwing, called the amentum in Latin, or the ἀγκύλος (ankúlos) in Greek. We will pause here very briefly to note several curiosities, to which we will return momentarily.\n\n \n\nThe word ἀγκύλος also refers to the joints or bend in the arm/wrist, and also idiomatically extends to the stiffening of those joints by disease. Additionally, a construction of the same word ἀγκύλαι χρυσόστροφοι denotes the bowstring.\n\n \n\nNow, the ankúlos was a thong of leather, wrapped around the arm and extended to loop over the first and second fingers. When loosed, the additional leverage provided the javelin with much greater distance. The soldier or athlete was free to adjust, to taste, the precise position along the shaft of the spear relative to its center of gravity, where the ankúlos was wrapped, negotiating between the gain of distance proportional to a loss of accuracy, and vice versa. When thrown, the ankúlos slipped free from the two extended fingers and released the javelin, gripped with the thumb; the third and fourth dactyls being curled into the palm. In other words, the two extended dactyls provide the leverage to the javelin, and together with the thumb, grip the weapon—and when loosed, the hand forms the shape of the benedictio. Thus the position of the symbolic fulmen atop those two fingers in the Hand of Sabazios is clarified.\n\n \n\nConsidering the two downturned digits, we find perhaps the single most persistent symbol in all the iconography of Sabazios: The serpent. Although broadly presented in esoteric study as a symbol of femininity—the serpent apparently gives birth to itself in the form of its shed skin, exits the old body as if wet from the womb, and thus neatly symbolizes both the immaculate conception, and the Indo-European idea that the provision of the bodily clay was the sexual dominion of the woman—we would nevertheless do well to recognize, for example, its more central position in the Orphic tradition. Seeing, as we do, that in the farther reaches of antiquity there is a clear and companion sense of the serpent as a masculine archetype as well.\n\n \n\nIn Plutarch’s Life of Alexander, we find the following version of the story of Alexander the Great’s conception, wherein Zeus impregnates the queen Olympia having taken the form of a serpent, and Philip, witnessing the event with one eye through the door, is destined to be blinded in that eye:\n\n \n\n“Once Philip found his wife asleep, with a large tame snake stretched beside her; and this, it is said, quite put an end to his passion for her, and made him avoid her society … We are told that Philip after this portent sent Chairon of Megalopolis to Delphi, to consult the god there, and that he delivered an oracular response bidding him sacrifice to Zeus Ammon, and to pay especial reverence to that god: warning him, moreover, that he would some day lose the sight of that eye with which, through the chink of the half-opened door, he had seen the god consorting with his wife in the form of a serpent.”\n\n \n\nIn 1963, D.J.A. Ross remarked off-hand (in an article titled Olympias and the Serpent) on the possibility that this particular episode is a reference to Sabazios, and the enigmatic initiation rites comprising the mysteries of that cult. In-hand with that notion, we might also produce a survey by Dunstan Lowe, over the passage in the Aeneid wherein Allecto drives Amata to madness. Lowe argues that the serpentine device in this episode is most surely intended to recall the Sabazian initiation rite, as well. The passage in question:\n\n \n\nStraightway Alecto, through whose body flows\n\nthe Gorgon poison, took her viewless way\n\nto Latium and the lofty walls and towers\n\nof the Laurentian King. Crouching she sate\n\nin silence on the threshold of the bower\n\nwhere Queen Amata in her fevered soul\n\npondered, with all a woman's wrath and fear,\n\nupon the Trojans and the marriage-suit\n\nof Turnus. From her Stygian hair the fiend\n\na single serpent flung, which stole its way\n\nto the Queen's very heart, that, frenzy-driven,\n\nshe might on her whole house confusion pour.\n\nBetwixt her smooth breast and her robe it wound\n\nunfelt, unseen, and in her wrathful mind\n\ninstilled its viper soul. Like golden chain\n\naround her neck it twined, or stretched along\n\nthe fillets on her brow, or with her hair\n\nenwrithing coiled; then on from limb to limb\n\nslipped tortuous. Yet though the venom strong\n\nthrilled with its first infection every vein,\n\nand touched her bones with fire, she knew it not …\n\n \n\nDuring initiation into the Sabazia, an artificial snake was passed down the neophyte’s chest underneath the tunic, so that it lay against the skin. Two such iron snakes have been uncovered in the so-called “Complex of the Magic Rites” in Pompeii. It has been suggested that a certain erotic effect may have been achieved by blinding the initiate, resulting in uncertainty over whether or not the snake was real. Perhaps on some occasions a live snake was in-fact used. The snake was passed, then, through the neck of the tunic, against the chest, downward and retrieved from underneath the hem of the garment at a suggestible location. There is undoubtedly a theurgic aspect central to this particular ritual; a notion of sexual union with the god—preserved as a device of myth in the story of Alexander’s conception.\n\n \n\nRebirth, then, is the crucial aspect of the symbolic mechanism—however, not necessarily in the ‘feminine’ light, for, just as the woman was believed to provide the bodily clay, inanimate, it was the man who provided the spark of life according to the Indo-European traditions. Thus was Orestes found innocent of the murder of a family member; he argued that his mother Klytemnestra, whom he killed in order to avenge the killing of his father, was not of his blood, being only his mother. The blood relation was, for the un-diluted Indo-European mind, exclusive to the father. Hence, we can understand the Jupiterian aspect of the Sabazian snake ritual, in the sense that it represents the living principle descending from the head, along the spine, and rendered in the form of sexual consummation (a doctrine expounded in Plato’s Timaeus, and its analog in the East, the image of the kundalini)—as the serpent passes down the body and is extracted at the genitals. The spinal fluid was long considered one and the same as the seminal fluid in both Pythagorean and Orphic traditions, among others. Equating the snake to the spine, in this sexual and essentially masculine form, then, we can come to understand just the same, the esoteric importance of a different commonly-held Indo-European belief, that being, the idea that after death the spine of the deceased occasions to be transformed into a snake.\n\n \n\nNow perhaps it’s somewhat clearer, the reasons for why priests of Sabazios are presented by ancient authors as snake-keepers; why snake-sleeping rituals among women—being shut up in the temple overnight alone but for a serpent—are associated with Sabazios, with Zeus, and with Dionysos alike, all of whom have been conflated at one point or another. This confluence of myth and ritual calls to mind, as well, a certain medieval epistle penned by the Christian John Meletius to George Sabine, detailing the practice of keeping snakes by the local Prussian pagans. He writes:\n\n \n\n“Moreover, the Lithuanians and Samogitae keep snakes warm under the stove, or in a corner of the steam-room where the table stands. These snakes they worship as they would a divine being; and at a regular season of the year the sacrificers summon them forth to share the meal. But they come out and climb up over a clean cloth and sit on the table. When they have there tasted the several dishes, they go down again and hide themselves in their holes. When the snakes have gone away the men gladly eat up the dishes of which they have had a first taste, and expect that for that year all things will turn out happily for them. If, however, the snakes have not come out in answer to the prayers of the sacrificer, or have refused to taste the dishes placed on the table, then they believe that in that year they will suffer some great calamity. …”\n\n \n\nRather than dwell on the point, it serves only to call to attention the fact that there was most likely among these peoples a tradition of great antiquity, which comprised the overlap between the notion of a household deity; the fatherly ancestral spirit (penates in the Latin, domovoi in the Slavic, etc.) and the serpent—for related reasons.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nFurther Considerations\n\n \n\nTo draw the present treatment of the Hands of Sabazios to a close then, it remains to discuss one further, albeit material, aspect of the serpentine symbolism. Why is the serpent consistently positioned over the two downturned digits in the benedictio, in the iconography of the cult?\n\n \n\nIn addition to the symbolic observations offered thus far it should be presented, too, that the benedictio shares its form—to a certain degree—with a medical affliction of the hand that was apparently well known to the ancients. The ‘ulnar claw’ has gone by many names; Celtic Hand, or Viking’s Hand. The Curse of the MacCrimmons, after the famous clan of pipers who suffered the genetic deformity and were doomed to lose the ability to play their instruments as they aged. As well, the Hand of Benediction, and more recently this condition was settled in the medical field under the name of the distinguished physician who first set down the underlying mechanism of the deformity in those terms: Guillaume Dupuytren; called “Dupuytren’s Contracture.” The affliction was originally thought to be unique to those of Nordic descent (hence ‘Viking’s Hand,’) although in more recent times it was recognized to have been prevalent among, strikingly, both Thracian and Phrygian populations historically—predating then, the medieval Nordic or Celtic associations.\n\n \n\nThe contracture is characterized by a thickening, and therefore contracting, of the tendons in the hand which control the third finger, and to a somewhat lesser extent the fourth finger as well. Protruding from the palm with more and more clarity, these tendons take on an unmistakably serpentine character, and render both smaller fingers unable to extend over time, thus slowly closing the hand permanently into the benedictio gesture.\n\n \n\nDupuytren’s contracture is not the only cause of this peculiar manual deformity, either. Leprosy typically presented earliest as a discoloration of the ring finger, followed on next by nerve damage in the forearm that resulted in the same ulnar-claw, in the hand. The tradition of Leper Knights in the Crusading epoch comes to mind. Further, a break in the elbow can commonly lead to the same nerve damage, and the same disfiguration of the hand. For these reasons (in addition to the symbolic reasons which underlie the apparent material concord of the hand with the doctrine) it’s not quite so convincing to claim that Dupuytren’s contracture is the source of the benedictio. But rather, that it’s presentation would of course have been seen as commensurate with a larger bodily cosmography, which was accepted by the Indo-European mentality—and by which the hand was taken for a microcosm of the body, and the body in-turn of the cosmos.\n\n \n\nThe contracture disproportionately affects men, rarely women. As well, it’s a genetic condition—and therefore would for man of antiquity have evidently passed from father to son, bolstering its association with the agnatic principle, and thereby have been perhaps understandably provisioned to the sky-father deities. Further, the contracture does not present in the hand until the 7th decade on average. While many approximations can be set down for the typical life span of a man in any given period of antiquity, the 5th generation is a reasonable estimate by any methodology. Which is to say, one would have to exceed the expected life span by twenty years, on average, in order to present the condition—and for this reason, would very likely have meant that the contracture was associated with uncommon longevity, or in other words, with health, or a significant constitution. Positioning the serpent then over the two ‘poisoned’ digits of such a hand again appears to follow rationally.\n\n \n\nOne final piece worth consideration would have us return to a curiosity presented earlier: the Greek word ἀγκύλος (ankúlos). Recall that in addition to the bowstring, this was the name given to the javelin thong, as well as the bend or joints in the arms, and, crucially, was lent to the deformities or deficiencies of the joints. In the ancient Greek the name for the bow, τόξον (toxon), is also the source of the word ‘toxic.’ The connotation of poison, and therefore a latent serpentine quality is to be found in the most common material from which the bow was made—the yew tree. The yew tree was known to the ancients for its longevity, and for its toxicity. The longevity of the tree is down to its slow growth, and as its capacity to regenerate from within. While the tree ages, its heartwood decays, and through that material as a humus, new roots grow down in the center the tree and a new trunk emerges outward from the center. Hollow yew trees are taken to be very ancient, indeed. It’s unlikely that the ancients were ignorant the draconic character of this process. We are left to wonder if the fact that an archer’s hand, loosing an arrow, typically forms the benedictio as well is a matter of simple coincidence.\n\n \n\nend.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nEditorial Note:\n\n​\n\nThe passages above, which detail the Mercurial\n\naspects of the Sabazian ritual staff, its relationship\n\nto the benedictio, and to proportion, have been\n\nappended to this paper shortly following \n\npublication. I would like to acknowledge \n\nMr. Gálvez Caballero, and thank him\n\nfor the conversation that resulted in\n\nthose additional insights."

  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/the-nomadic-influence",
  "content": "So much of our historical perspective is, in one way or another, the product of a broadly agrarian disposition. And yet, in the plains that stretch out in between sedentary civilities, there arose in counterpoint peoples who were defined more by the domestication of the horse, than of grain.  As early as we can remember there was violence between pastoral and agrarian peoples; a tidal wax and wane of warriors stampeding out of the steppe characterizes the history of Europe and Asia; empires which were before unassailable, taken to pieces and devastated by peoples who then disappeared into the ethnography. As a result, there exist countless legends of plains peoples; peerless warriors and conquerors—which, while earned, also provides a curious lens through which to view the more granular differences, that separate nomadic cultures from their agrarian counterparts.\n\n \n\nThe rider crests the rise, fur-clad and bow in hand; a silhouette that inspired fear for a millennium. Sycthians, Huns, Parthians, Magyars, Göktürks, Mongols, Timurids and Mughals are all iterations of the essential pastoral horse culture, which stormed down out of the Eurasian steppe again and again. This manner of living appears innate to the domesticated horse—cultural facsimiles arose in the New World in short order after the introduction of horses into the great plains of North and South America, in the form of tribes such as the Mapuche, and the Cheyenne. The primary feature, and essential virtue of the pastoral horse-culture, contrasted with agrarian cultures, is mobility. Mobility is a reflexive principle for such a way of life, it allows the horses to thrive, and in-turn allows the nomad to thrive himself in an otherwise inhospitable environment. The fall of the Roman west, and later Byzantium at Constantinople, the end of the Jin dynasty, the razing of Khwarezm and the subjugation of Kievan Rus, are all works of pastoral peoples.\n\n \n\nHorse-culture emerges in history among nomadic peoples, likely for the simple reason that the care and maintenance of the horse is rendered prohibitively resource intensive otherwise. Agrarian societies must grow enough crops to support not just themselves, but any livestock they keep as well—and not only through the growing season but also through barren winter months. Livestock that provides a steadier return on these investments is often prioritized, as with dairy goats, or cattle for milk and cheese, or poultry for eggs. The surplus required to maintain a horse, especially one not dedicated to plow-pulling but rather bred and trained for war, is a luxury reserved for noble classes. Indeed, the keeping of horses is frequently the bar by which nobility is measured—the terms Equite and Chevalier literally refer societal rank to the ability to serve as cavalrymen.\n\n \n\nAlternatively, in the sprawling grasses of the steppe, the absence of a horse is more taxing to a man’s survival than the presence of one. So long as he is able to move with the seasons, the plains will provide a man all the fodder he needs to sustain a herd of horses. However, a man with no horse could find himself stranded without water, in a storm far from cover or at the mercy of wolves. Amid the wide expanses of the steppes, with few landmarks and fewer villages, moving between seasons as he must, a man without a horse is a cripple. A Mongol warrior outfitted for war would have at least five steeds. Maintaining them was simply matter of traveling with the herd to fresh stretches of grass, rather than needing to spend time growing hay, or building and maintaining barns and stables.\n\n \n\nThe individual bricks which comprise the edifice we call civilization are defined by the local clay, so to speak. Take any given man out of a hundred in a sedentary, pre-industrial culture, and he will be a farmer by betting odds. It’s a given then that the most common soldier from sedentary cultures will be a farmer with a spear. Compare him to any freedman of the steppe, who was a horseman before he could be anything else. Even those unhorsed men in the lowest station of life have no crops to harvest in the fall, and a home that rolls on a wagon—a life always on campaign. War is a seasonal pastime for the settled, not only due to inclement weather that could mire a march, but more centrally because the nation’s food supply needed to be brought in from the fields. A professional army mitigates this problem but itself demands a much more intricate infrastructure; one which has the man-power and resources to spare in order to defend and maintain supply lines. The ability to cover decent milage in a day, and to set up a disciplined camp at the end of it, defines a competent soldiery as much as being able to fight in formation.\n\n \n\nIt goes without saying that a mounted man will cover more distance in a day than one marching. We can see, perhaps now, how persistent legends about the “scourge of God” begin to take shape. Such an army is, by its innate composition, able to move faster and further than other, more-familiar enemies. It’s a force which is unbound by supply lines, or harvest seasons because its supply of food follows in herds, or is taken physically by far-foraging raiding parties, and for whom a life in tents is hardly different from being at home. Again, mobility is the essential virtue, and it is essentially foreign to agrarian society. The Gauls, the Romans, the Carthaginians and the Goths all fought wars on similar terms, when compared with Atilla.\n\n \n\nAnother curious aspect of the horse-nomad cultures is their ability to suddenly present in enormous numbers—if every man on the plains is ripe for conscription, an empire-toppling army can be conjured out of the dust. Or so it may seem to any sedentary society bordering the apparent wastes of the steppe. All they need is to be given common cause, be it by some environmental pressure in drought or harsh winter, or unified by a successful warlord. The opportunity for a domino effect exists where one tribe uses the strength of subsuming another to conquer a third, until the whole of the steppe is united under one banner. So the sudden appearance of a horde where before there was only an expanse of grass—on account of an Atilla, a Temudgin or a Tamerlane. The problems implicit in consolidation and occupation; the idiosyncrasies and religious abstention, cultural quirks, and foreign tongues all conspire to make similar exponential conquests implausible for agrarian peoples. Because the pastoral tribes’ ways of life are so interwoven and wide-traveled a rider in Scythia and one from Manchuria could have more in common than than two settled men living across a river border. An added facet of this effect is a familiarity with rolling local command-structures into an existing army. Any who submit can be spared and their chain of command can remain intact, for your own use. The tendency to allow local rule so long as tribute demands were met, and subservience assured, are deals of a sort which agrarian kings were much less willing to make, and much less able to enforce with fewer mobile soldiers.     \n\n \n\nThe image of the nomadic horseman goes beyond a general unfamiliarity with their logistical capabilities, however. The only thing faster on the steppe than the rider is his arrow. The sprawling distances between any two noteworthy things on the steppe means hunting on foot is a practice of limited utility. Protecting flock and herd from a pack of wolves or pride of lions demands the reach to be able to engage several enemies from one position. The pressures exist then even before war, to create a bow that is powerful while still being able to be drawn and fired from horseback. There is a companion pressure as well, for the cultivation of riders skilled enough to wield such a weapon. Again, the demands of daily life for a pastoral nomad make for a much more ready transition to useful soldiery, than do the typical rigors of agricultural toil, or, more urban fancies. It’s a type of soldiery that is not easily replicated in sedentary society—many of which opted instead to hire nomadic horsemen as mercenaries rather than try to train them up domestically. While it is assuredly of use to be able to ride down a fleeing enemy and strike him in range of the bow, or to launch a volley in a charge, the most telling advantage of mounted archery is its ability to recede ever-away from any opponent, even as you pepper him with arrows. That particular feat of archery and horsemanship; a warrior leveling fire backward while using only his knees to drive his horse forward is called the Parthian Shot, in reference to the pastoral Parthians who first acquainted the Romans with it.\n\n \n\nAs a result, they don’t fit neatly into the plans of a general who previously had only  encountered the light javelin-throwing riders of settled lands, or later, the heavily armored lance bearers. Horse archers could harass and harry more aggressively and more continuously than other types of light cavalry. It’s rare that nomadic horsemen would be equipped with the sort of armor, and with horses well-suited to a heavy cavalry shock charge, but they were more than capable of lance and saber work after softening a target. The particular tactic of receding away from a charge can often lead to the mistaken impression of a rout, by the uninitiated. Formations can be undone by ill-fated attempts to pursue, creating in turn an opportunity for encirclement—famously, for example at the battle of Carrhae 53 BCE.\n\n \n\nAccording to these forces was the largest contiguous empire in history formed. In-line with a manner of society uniquely suited to an eccentric soldiery, which defies conventional tactics; whose mobility, supply and adaptable command structures thwarted not just European empires, but imperial powers in the Middle East and Asia as well, time-and-again. It's evident then, how horse archers came to be considered the most ideal soldiers or warriors, especially by Moderns, and grew to be coveted above all others in some circles.\n\n \n\nLet us consider then why so often the tide seems to recede, either into the sedentary population they have come to rule or fading back into the steppe from whence they came. The massive size of pastoral empires frequently goes hand in hand with their short lives, as they either develop into sedentary nations or break apart into the many disparate tribes and rulers the conquering forces was originally composed of.\n\n \n\nWe ought to consider again the nomadic horseman as an individual—we have a substantive count of whats in his favor, but what is it that he lacks? The fruits of the steppe are but little. There is game, and fodder for livestock whose skins can be made in leather for yurts and clothing; their bones and sinews into bows. Mares’ milk can be drank, and a lame horse can be eaten and so it goes for sheep, camels, and cattle. That is more-or-less the end of the list, of conveniently acquired resources out in the grasslands. Trade then, is an critically important feature of life on the steppe—giving what can be had for what cannot, or else taking a cut for allowing merchant caravans to pass unmolested. There are numberless luxuries and accoutrements available to settled societies that can’t be manufactured on the steppe, particularly as any manufacturing capacity must be able to be packed away on a wagon and moved. It becomes difficult then to justify keeping anything which doesn’t see daily use, when one moves so frequently.\n\n \n\nMobility on this scale can relegate things like the development of a written language, for example, to a matter of trifling importance. As well, it can understandably render pursuits like blacksmithing far more difficult. The struggle of metalworking in the grasslands and the absence of ore is  why for the pastoral horse archer; the production of his armor or other weapons, and things like craftsmans’ tools all commonly required an outside source of supply —which could easily be cut off by a savvy neighbor, when the tribes became restive. It also meant that the man of the steppe lacked recourse to viable alternatives. They do not have the means to alter their tactics toward heavily armored charges or infantry formations even if the situation calls for it. He is a horse archer because he can be nothing else. The specialization of skill and breadth of resources available to a settled society allows the pursuit of any wartime vocation, though horse archers are comparatively more expensive to train and equip if they are not available as mercenaries.\n\n\nSo, even as the horse archer is an inevitable conclusion of life on the steppe, he is maladapted to environments beyond it. Some of the cataclysms brought-on by pastoral raiders has as much to do with sedentary populations pushed out of their homes, into areas the nomads themselves would avoid. The hearty steeds of the steppe are as vulnerable to uneven or obstructed terrain as any other, and so mountainous, forested or boggy terrain can all be impassable to a horde of horsemen. Taking and holding any particular location is counterproductive in a grassland, as local grazing will be quickly exhausted. A horse archer’s most devastating tactic also precludes holding any swathe of land not large enough to allow them to gallop away as a matter of common tactic. While the particular mobility of the nomads can allow them to appear unlooked for, and their methods and tactics can be foreign, they can also be subverted or circumvented. Massed volley fire by infantry archers can out-shoot mounted archers due to the difficulty of the skill on horseback. Horsemen are as vulnerable to over extension and encirclement as any army, as proven at Ain Jalut. A well supplied fortress or walled city can resist riders alone indefinitely. Still more efficient however, would be to avoid the fight entirely.\n\n \n\n“The supreme art of warfare is to subdue your enemy without fighting”\n\n \n\nWords written by a man doubtlessly familiar with nomadic combatants, Sun Tzu. Manipulation of tribal rivalries and the careful management of tribute payments and trade, were the best tactics for agrarian peoples to ensure that no force on the steppe reached a critical mass, and charged out of it.\n\n \n\nAs a final point it’s worth clarifying that ruling over a settled civilization often requires a settled court to maintain it. The convoluted bureaucracies that manage agricultural society need an axle to turn about, in a manner of speaking. Scribes and record keepers and tax collectors serve their purpose. A palace requires a quarry, and a mason just as much as a king. So the conqueror must either adapt to sedentary life or else take as much as he can carry back out into the steppe. Adaptation to agrarian pressures is a feat which provided mixed success, best preformed in areas which neighbor the plains so that both ways of life can be preserved. Succession crises are common, however, because it is far easier to split a herd than a kingdom, and so the customs of inheritance are often not robust enough to keep a young empire born of nomadic conquest intact.\n\n \n\nAdaptation goes both ways however, and so, even as nomadic peoples might buffer their vulnerabilities with the service of settled peoples or by adopting their customs, opposed kingdoms train and evolve to exploit them. History is replete with examples of the lines between what amounts to a pastoral society, and an agrarian one, becoming blurred, until there remains some new kingdom with its back turned to the grassland. Then, of course, the riders re-emerge. One may be left to wonder, since industrialization finally outmoded horses and bows, what we might have lost by the forging of a Modern world in which there are no alternative ways to live."

  "title": "The Greek View of Art",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/greek-view-of-art",
  "content": "Greek Art as an Expression of National Life\n\n \n\nIn approaching the subject of the Art of the Greeks we come to what, more plausibly than any other, may be regarded as the central point of their scheme of life. We have already noticed, in dealing with other topics, how constantly the aesthetic point of view emerges and predominates in matters with which, in the modern way of looking at things, it appears to have no direct and natural connection. We saw, for example, how inseparable in their religion was the element of ritual and ceremony from that of idea; how in their ethical conceptions the primary notion was that of beauty; how they aimed throughout at a perfect balance of body and soul, and more generally, in every department, at an expression of the inner by the outer so complete and perfect that the conception of a separation of the two became almost as impossible to their thought as it would have been unpleasing and discordant to their feeling. Now such a point of view is, in fact, that of art; and philosophers of history have been amply justified in characterising the whole Greek epoch as pre-eminently that of Beauty.\n\n \n\nBut if this be a true way of regarding the matter, we should expect to find that art and beauty had, for the Greeks, a very wide and complex significance. There is a view of art, and it is one that appears to be prevalent in our own time, which sets it altogether outside the general trend of national life and ideas; which asserts that it has no connection with ethics, religion, politics, or any of the general conceptions which regulate action and thought; that its end is in itself, and is simply beauty; and that in beauty there is no distinction of high or low, no preference of one kind above another. Art thus conceived is, in the first place, purely subjective in character; the artist alone is the standard, and any phase or mood of his, however exceptional, personal and transitory, is competent to produce a work of art as satisfying and as great as one whose inspiration was drawn from a nation's life, reflecting its highest moments, and its most universal aspirations and ideals; so that, for example, a butterfly drawn by Mr. Whistler would rank as high, say, as the Parthenon. And in the second place, in this view of art, the subject is a matter of absolute indifference. The standards of ordinary life, ethical or other, do not apply; there is no better or worse, but only a more or less beautiful; and the representation of a music-hall stage or a public house bar may be as great and perfect a work of art as the Venus of Milo or the Madonna of Raphael.\n\n \n\nThis theory, which arises naturally and perhaps inevitably in an age where national life has degenerated into materialism and squalor, and the artist feels himself a stranger in a world of Philistines, we need not here pause to examine and criticise. It has been mentioned merely to illustrate by contrast the Greek view, which was diametrically opposed to this, and valued art in proportion as it represented in perfect form the highest and most comprehensive aspects of the national ideal.\n\n \n\nTo say this, is not, of course, to say that the Greek conception of art was didactic; for the word didactic, when applied to art, has usually the implication that the excellence of the moral is the only point to be considered, and that if that is good the work itself must be good. This idea does indeed occur in Greek thought—we find it, for example, paradoxically enough, in so great an artist as Plato—but if it had been the one which really determined their production, there would have been no occasion to write this chapter, for there would have been no Greek art to write about. The truer account of the impulse that urged them to create is that given also by Plato in an earlier and more impassioned work, in which he describes it as a \"madness of those who are possessed by the Muses; which enters into a delicate and virgin soul, and there inspiring frenzy, awakens lyrical and all other numbers; with these adorning the myriad actions of ancient heroes for the instruction of posterity. But he who having no touch of the Muses' madness in his soul, comes to the door and thinks that he will get into the temple by the help of art—he, I say, and his poetry are not admitted; the sane man is nowhere at all when he enters into rivalry with the madman.\" [Footnote: Plato, Phaedrus, 245a.—Translated by Jowett.]\n\n \n\nThe presupposition, in fact, of all that can be said about the Greek view of art, is that primarily and to begin with they were, by nature, artists. Judged simply by the aesthetic standard, without any consideration of subject matter at all, or any reference to intellectual or ethical ideals, they created works of art more purely beautiful than those of any other age or people. Their mere household crockery, their common pots and pans, are cast in shapes so exquisitely graceful, and painted in designs so admirably drawn and composed, that any one of them has a higher artistic value than the whole contents of the Royal Academy; and the little clay figures they used as we do china ornaments put to shame the most ambitious efforts of modern sculpture. Who, for example, would not rather look at a Tanagra statuette than at the equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington?\n\n \n\nThe Greeks, in fact, quite apart from any theories they may have held, were artists through and through; and that is a fact we must carry with us through the whole of our discussion.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nIdentification of the Aesthetic and Ethical Points of View\n\n \n\nBut on the other hand, it seems to be clear from all that we can learn, that their habitual way of regarding works of art was not to judge them simply and exclusively by their aesthetic value. On the contrary, in criticising two works otherwise equally beautiful, they would give a higher place to the one or the other for its ethical or quasi-ethical qualities. This indeed is what we should expect from the comprehensive sense which, as we have seen, attached in their tongue to the word which we render \"beautiful.\" The aesthetic and ethical spheres, in fact, were never sharply distinguished by the Greeks; and it follows that as, on the one hand, their conception of the good was identified with that of the beautiful, so, on the other hand, their conception of the beautiful was identified with that of the good. Thus the most beautiful work of art, in the Greek sense of the term, was that which made the finest and most harmonious appeal not only to the physical but to the moral sense, and while communicating the highest and most perfect pleasure to the eye or the ear, had also the power to touch and inform the soul with the grace which was her moral excellence. Of this really characteristic Greek conception, this fusion, so instinctive as to be almost unconscious, of the aesthetic and ethical points of view, no better illustration could be given than the following passage from the Republic of Plato, where the philosopher is describing the effect of beautiful works of art, and especially of music, on the moral and intellectual character of his imaginary citizens:\n\n \n\n\"'We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul. Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful: then will our youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a healthgiving breeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.'\n\n\"'There can be no nobler training than that,' he replied.\n\n \n\n\"'And therefore,' I said, \"'Glaucon, musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a true taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why: and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.\"[Footnote: Plato, Republic III. 401.—Translated by Jowett.]\n\n \n\nThis fusion of the ideas of the beautiful and the good is the central point in the Greek Theory of Art; and it enables us to understand how it was that they conceived art to be educational. Its end, in their view, was not only pleasure, though pleasure was essential to it; but also, and just as much, edification. Plato, indeed, here again exaggerating the current view, puts the edification above the pleasure. He criticises Homer as he might criticise a moral philosopher, pointing out the inadequacy, from an ethical point of view, of his conception of heaven and of the gods, and dismissing as injurious and of bad example to youthful citizens the whole tissue of passionate human feeling, the irrepressible outbursts of anger and grief and fear, by virtue of which alone the Iliad and the Odyssey are immortal poems instead of ethical tracts. And finally, with a half reluctant assent to the course of his own argument, he excludes the poets altogether from his ideal republic, on the ground that they encourage their hearers in that indulgence of emotion which it is the object of every virtuous man to repress. The conclusion of Plato, by his own admission, was half paradoxical, and it certainly never recommended itself to such a nation of artists as the Greeks. But it illustrates, nevertheless, the general bent of their views of art, that tendency to the identification of the beautiful and the good, which, while it was never pushed so far as to choke art with didactics—for Plato himself, even against his own will, is a poet—yet served to create a standard of taste which was ethical as much as aesthetic, and made the judgment of beauty also a judgment of moral worth.\n\n \n\nQuite in accordance with this view we find that the central aim of all Greek art is the representation of human character and human ideals. The interpretation of \"nature\" for its own sake (in the narrower sense in which \"nature\" is opposed to man) is a modern and romantic development that would have been unintelligible to a Greek. Not that the Greeks were without a sense of what we call the beauties of nature, but that they treat them habitually, not as the centre of interest, but as the background to human activity. The most beautiful descriptions of nature to be found in Greek poetry occur, incidentally only, in the choral odes introduced into their dramas; and among all their pictures of which we have any record there is not one that answers to the description of a landscape; the subject is always mythological or historical, and the representation of nature merely a setting for the main theme. And on the other hand, the art for which the Greeks are most famous, and in which they have admittedly excelled all other peoples, is that art of sculpture whose special function it is not only to represent but to idealise the human form, and which is peculiarly adapted to embody for the sense not only physical but ethical types. And, more remarkable still, as we shall have occasion to observe later, the very art which modern men regard as the most devoid of all intellectual content, the most incommensurable with any standard except that of pure beauty—I refer of course to the art of music—was invested by the Greeks with a definite moral content and worked into their general theory of art as a direct interpretation of human life. The excellence of man, in short, directly or indirectly, was the point about which Greek art turned; that excellence was at once aesthetic and ethical; and the representation of what was beautiful involved also the representation of what was good. This point we will now proceed to illustrate more in detail in connection with the various special branches of art.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nSculpture and Painting\n\n \n\nLet us take, first, the plastic arts, sculpture and painting; and to bring into clear relief the Greek point of view let us contrast with it that of the modern \"impressionist.\" To the impressionist a picture is simply an arrangement of colour and line; the subject represented is nothing, the treatment everything. It would be better, on the whole, not even to know what objects are depicted; and, to judge the picture by a comparison with the objects, or to consider what is the worth of the objects in themselves, or what we might think of them if we came across them in the connections of ordinary life, is simply to misconceive the whole meaning of a picture. For the artist and for the man who understands art, all scales and standards disappear except that of the purely aesthetic beauty which consists in harmony of line and tone; the most perfect human form has no more value than a splash of mud; or rather both mud and human form disappear as irrelevant, and all that is left for judgment is the arrangement of colour and form originally suggested by those accidental and indifferent phenomena.\n\n \n\nIn the Greek view, on the other hand, though we certainly cannot say that the subject was everything and the treatment nothing (for that would be merely the annihilation of art) yet we may assert that, granted the treatment, granted that the work was beautiful (the first and indispensable requirement) its worth was determined by the character of the subject. Sculpture and painting, in fact, to the Greeks, were not merely a medium of aesthetic pleasure; they were ways of expressing and interpreting national life. As such they were subordinated to religion. The primary end of sculpture was to make statues of the gods and heroes; the primary end of painting was to represent mythological scenes; and in either case the purely aesthetic pleasure was also a means to a religious experience.\n\n \n\nLet us take, for example, the statue of Zeus at Olympia, the most famous of the works of Pheidias. This colossal figure of ivory and gold was doubtless, according to all the testimony we possess, from a merely aesthetic point of view, among the most consummate creations of human genius. But what was the main aim of the artist who made it? what the main effect on the spectator? The artist had designed and the spectator seemed to behold a concrete image of that Homeric Zeus who was the centre of his religious consciousness—the Zeus who \"nodded his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved from the King's immortal head, and he made great Olympus quake.\" [Footnote: Iliad i. 528.—Translated by Lang, Leaf and Myers.] \"Those who approach the temple,\" says Lucian, \"do not conceive that they see ivory from the Indies or gold from the mines of Thrace; no, but the very son of Kronos and Rhea, transported by Pheidias to earth and set to watch over the lonely plain of Pisa.\" \"He was,\" says Dion Chrysostom, \"the type of that unattained ideal, Hellas come to unity with herself; in expression at once mild and awful, as befits the giver of life and all good gifts, the common father, saviour and guardian of men; dignified as a king, tender as a father, awful as giver of laws, kind as protector of suppliants and friends, simple and great as giver of increase and wealth; revealing, in a word, in form and countenance, the whole array of gifts and qualities proper to his supreme divinity.\"\n\n \n\nThe description is characteristic of the whole aim of Greek sculpture,— the representation not only of beauty, but of character, not only of character but of character idealised. The statues of the various gods derive their distinguishing individuality not merely from their association with conventional symbols, but from a concrete reproduction, in features, expression, drapery, pose, of the ethical and intellectual qualities for which they stand. An Apollo differs in type from a Zeus, an Athene from a Demeter; and in every case the artist works from an intellectual conception, bent not simply on a graceful harmony of lines, but on the representation of a character at once definite and ideal.\n\n \n\nPrimarily, then, Greek sculpture was an expression of the national religion; and therefore, also, of the national life. For, as we saw, the cult of the gods was the centre, not only of the religious but of the political consciousness of Greece; and an art which was born and flourished in the temple and the sacred grove, naturally became the exponent of the ideal aspect of the state. It was thus, for example, that the Parthenon at Athens was at once the centre of the worship of Athene, and a symbol of the corporate life over which she presided; the statue of the goddess having as its appropriate complement the frieze over which the spirit of the city moved in stone. And thus, too, the statues of the victors at the Olympian games were dedicated in the sacred precinct, as a memorial of what was not only an athletic meeting, but also at once a centre of Hellenic unity and the most consummate expression of that aspect of their culture which contributed at least as much to their aesthetic as to their physical perfection.\n\n \n\nSculpture, in fact, throughout, was subordinated to religion, and through religion to national life; and it was from this that it derived its ideal and intellectual character. And, so far as our authorities enable us to judge, the same is true of painting. The great pictures of which we have descriptions were painted to adorn temples and public buildings, and represented either mythological or national themes. Such, for example, was the great work of Polygnotus at Delphi, in which was depicted on the one hand the sack of Troy, on the other the descent of Odysseus into Hades; and such his representation of the battle of Marathon, in the painted porch that led to the Acropolis of Athens. And even the vase paintings of which we have innumerable examples, and which are mere decorations of common domestic utensils, have often enough some story of gods and heroes for their theme, whereby over and above their purely aesthetic value they made their appeal to the general religious consciousness of Greece. Painting, like sculpture, had its end, in a sense, outside itself; and from this very fact derived its peculiar dignity, simplicity, and power.\n\n \n\nFrom this account of the plastic art of the Greeks it follows as a simple corollary, that their aim was not merely to reproduce but to transcend nature. For their subject was gods and heroes, and heroes and gods were superior to men. Of this idealising tendency we have in sculpture evidence enough in the many examples which have been preserved to us; and with regard to painting there is curious literary testimony to the same effect. Aristotle, for example, remarks that \"even if it is impossible that men should be such as Zeuxis painted them, yet it is better that he should paint them so; for the example ought to excel that for which it is an example.\" [Footnote: Artist, Poet, xxv.—1461. 6. 12.]\n\n \n\nAnd in an imaginary conversation recorded between Socrates and Parrhasius the artist admits without any hesitation that more pleasure is to be derived from pictures of men who are morally good than from those of men who are morally bad. In the Greek view, in fact, as we saw, physical and moral excellence went together, and it was excellence they sought to depict in their art; not merely aesthetic beauty, though that was a necessary presupposition, but on the top of that, ideal types of character representative of their conception of the hero and the god. Art, in a word, was subordinate to the ethical ideal; or rather the ethical and aesthetic ideals were not yet dissociated; and the greatest artists the world has ever known worked deliberately under the direction and inspiration of the ideas that controlled and determined the life of their time."

  "content": "The Problem\n\n \n\nWhen in 1877 the estimable Willhelm Dorpfeld joined the ongoing excavations at Olympia, he formulated a peculiar hypothesis regarding the temple of Hera. Dorpfeld was convinced that the Heraion must have been originally constructed with wooden columns, not the stone columns which have lain in ruins on the site, now, for centuries. Further he reasoned that those original wooden columns were replaced much later, with stone columns, one-by-one and over a long period of time. According to Dorpfeld it’s in that patchwork renovated state that the temple appears to us today, now entirely stone—as we might expect of a classical Greek temple. This strange picture of the Heraion was drawn up in order to account for one particular eccentricity in the temple’s design: The stone columns and their capitals are highly variable. They differ in ways, which those same components in other Greek temples do not. The diameters of some columns are thicker, while others are thinner. Some are made of a single monolithic block of stone, others are made of several drums—of no consistent height. The forms of the capitals are even stranger; entirely divergent, some are shallow, others deep, some are wide, others narrow, some larger and others smaller. There is a much greater degree of inconsistency in the design of those members at Olympia, than there is in any other Doric temple in the ancient Greek world.\n\n \n\nThe question has caused many archaeologists like Dorpfeld to scratch their heads; what led the architect (or architects, according to some theories) to such a patchwork design? All of the prevailing hypotheses on the question are in many ways only shades of the same idea—that the columns differ so drastically, because they were all erected one-by-one at different times by different designers. Before disabusing scholars of that picture, however, we will need to examine why the idea was so alluring to begin with. It arose, as we will see, from flawed readings of both Pausanias and Vitruvius, in addition to a willingness to impose a degree of modern prejudice on the architect of antiquity. A clear and simple rationale has yet to be proposed, which describes the Heraion as being the result of a single architect, in a single construction period, according to deliberate intention. That is our task.\n\n \n\nFollowing the collapse of the Bronze Age; the fall of Mycenae and the passing of the great hilltop palatial kingdoms, the Greek culture entered a period where comparatively little permanent materials come down to us in the archaeological record. The Greeks forgot the techniques of working stone to architectural ends—much the same as Medieval Romans no longer possessed the technology to raise an unreinforced concrete dome on the scale of the Pantheon, despite the fact that they lived every day in its shadow. Across time and culture, again and again, we find ourselves wandering the ruins of our ancestors—having been lowered from prior heights of understanding, and capability. It was the same with the Anglo-Saxons, looking on and inhabiting the stone architectures left to collapse by the Romans in England, having then exited the stage of history—emulating those silent masons and their ghostly work, as in-time it occurred to them to do so; to rise. Specific dates for the lull in the Greek story varies from scholar to scholar. We may call the period between 1100 BCE and 750 BCE a reasonable estimate, by any reckoning. That span of time is referred to by archaeologists as the dark ages.\n\n \n\nThe Heraion occupies a critical moment in the story of Greek architecture, for the simple reason that it’s among the very oldest stone temples that exist following the dark ages. The Heraion, which is now dated with some appreciable degree of certainty to the final decade of the 7th century, thus represents one of the earliest attempts by the Greeks to embark on the task of raising their temples in stone, instead of perishable materials like timber. Masonry, of course, and as we will see, is a trade all to itself. The Heraion has therefore long-since enchanted those scholars who concern themselves with the question of the origins of the Doric Order.\n\n \n\nDorpfeld had his own designs. For him, the picture was continuous to a fault—he envisioned the Doric temple as part of an unbroken architectural continuum from the Classical and Hellenistic Greeks, directly back to their Bronze Age forebears, which carried through the dark ages. Dorpfeld viewed this picture as having been verified by Vitruvius’s remarks on the origin of the the Doric order, and this resulted in a kind-of architectural presentism, which held that the genesis of the Doric manner could be explained away as a utilitarian copy of an earlier, wooden prototype. That is, that the form and ornament of the temple was essentially resultant from skeuomorphism and mimicry. Said another way, Vitruvius’s observation that the Doric scheme’s ornament appeared to ‘petrify’ the form of a wooden scheme was defensible from a positivistic standpoint; top-down, as a matter of engineering. The young Greek mason, then, unsure of what to build, simply looked at a wooden temple and copied it in stone down to the details. This acute misconception led Dorpfeld to offer a date for the Heraion’s construction, which was far, far too early. When he returned to excavate the site for the second time he solidified that theory by advancing several more assertions. He claimed to have identified an earlier temple, atop which was raised the present stone temple. The present temple, he further argued, was in-fact the third construction. In between the first and third, he believed, an ash layer present in the stratigraphy suggested a second temple that had burned down.\n\n \n\nThus, Dorpfeld contributed to a persistent academic dogma surrounding the birth of the Doric monument. According to his picture, the initial Heraion dated to the end of the Bronze Age. The second and third constructions then carried that site through the dark ages, and supplied a prototype for the rest of the Classical architectural canon. Wooden temples are then copied into stone by new generations of Greek stonemasons, and those stone copies further copied in-turn. Thus the Heraion (more specifically, its peristyle) was cast by Dorpfeld, and others, as structure that was originally wooden, and was literally transformed, on-site, over the years by different architects, piece by piece, into a stone temple.\n\n \n\nHis argument for this was centered on the belief that the peristyle’s wooden columns must have rotted over the long centuries, spanning the lifespan that his three-temple scheme required. When they rotted individually, they were replaced piecemeal with stone columns according to the fashion. Their different form and patchwork aesthetic, then, as Dorpfeld argued, was due to the changing stylistic sensibilities of the time, and to the personal tastes of the individuals who oversaw those restorations. In this way Dorpfeld provided a century’s worth of anthropologists with a case study that seemed both to conclusively depict the theory of Vitruvius, and, to agree with an account of the temple left by Pausanias. It also sat well with materialistically minded scholars, who delight at the idea that ornamentation can be explained mechanistically.\n\n \n\nAfter Dorpfeld’s death, W.B. Dinsmoor and colleagues set to work correcting the chronology at the Heraion. The presence of an ash layer was not at all conclusive, and, with that was abandoned the alleged second temple. Evidence for the third temple likewise proved wishful at best, and so Dorpfeld’s three temples were again reduced to one; to the single construction which remains still today, on site. The Bronze Age date for the original construction was again disputed for numerous reasons, and more recent work has fixed the date of construction no earlier than the last decade of the 7th century. We’ll spare the reader the particulars of that discussion, here. Well and good. But then, why do most contemporary academics still generally believe that the Heraion was initially either in-part or in-whole a wooden structure, renovated with stone? Dorpfeld’s hypothesis required centuries for the wooden members to rot, in order to justify their renovation. Why should we believe that the temple was not simply constructed as we see it, to begin with—that is, constructed in stone at the start?\n\n \n\nThe answer to this question is twofold. First, the account given by Pausanias, which we can set aside momentarily. Second, critically, that there is no sufficient explanation for such variance noted in the peristyle—if indeed the peristyle was constructed at once, altogether, and according to the intentional designs of a single architect. Archaeologists are unable to see how such a construction could have been anything other than the compilation of stylistic whimsy over time by different interlopers. How could one architect have intended the columns and capitals to be so different?\n\n \n\nThe problem isn’t with the idea of petrification per se. The closer one looks, the more difficult the argument becomes—the devil is in the details. For example, petrification absolutists point out that the triglyphs in the temple are clearly reminiscent of the ends of compound beams, and the metopes then represent the spaces between them in a timber structure. The mutules and guttae obviously represent nailers which fixed the beams in place. At a glance, this makes sense. It is too clear to dismiss from the relevant rationale. But does it hold up as the sole, or total rationale? Not at all. The triglyphs, for example, wrap all four facades in the Doric temple in the same horizontal plane. Consider a moment further, that if the architects simply derived their ornamental scheme by copying a wooden prototype, triglyphs would only make sense on the long side of the temple, where the beam ends protruded as they spanned the short dimension. Triglyphs interpreted this way present two complete absurdities: beams spanning the far-longer dimension, both impossible to fabricate and serving no structural purpose, and further, beams that physically overlap in space with the transverse beams, in an impossible fashion. Why depict triglyphs on the temple’s short facades, where in timber, there would have been no such form at all? There is no satisfactory answer from a materialistic perspective.\n\n \n\nAnother common point to make, against the absolutist picture of petrification, is the ‘inverted’ form of Greek columnar fluting. Having learned from the Egyptians, it’s curious why the Greeks developed the manner of convoke, or scalloped flutes, when the Egyptians fluted their columns in the opposite fashion; with concave or an outwardly-rounded form. The reason for the Egyptian form is clearly meant to recall a column comprising bundled timbers. A common ornament on such a column in Egypt are the horizontal bands that would bond those reed columns. It makes sense for that ornament, should it descend from mimicry, to bow outward. Why, then, do the Greek flutes recede inward? They must serve some other purpose, beyond or before mimicry. The list of similar issues is lengthy. The petrification theory is simply insufficient to explain the aesthetic origin the Doric monument with any finality.\n\n \n\nThe form of the temple and the materials used to render it exist in an imperfect, reflexive relationship. Some compromises are always made in the form, for the sake of economy, and some compromises are made in economy for the sake of form. That is the architect’s torment. In the ancient world, the architect worked to minimize the sacrifice of form for the sake of economy, and we for our part in the modern world behave the opposite. Understanding this is the first step toward understanding the Heraion.\n\n \n\nStone, in contrast to timber, provided the Greek architect a different set of material conditions with which to approach the design. Because of its entirely different material properties, and therefore on account of the fact that it lent itself differently to the traditional, microcosmic task, the architect was able to achieve a much higher degree of harmony across the building—given that tradition—as a whole. To take the question of the triglyphs again, for example, that specific ornament could now ring all four facades of the temple with a rhythm that was both familiar, yet, impossible with timbers—as they would have overlapped one another in space, and so on and so forth. The temple’s organizational principles, with stone, therefore experienced an astonishing degree of expressive regularization, which, up to that point would have been out of the question. Things that were material necessities were suddenly released into the metaphysical realm of architectural consideration.\n\n \n\nThe architect’s repertoire of form and ornamentation, therefore; his ordering system, found a purer articulation. One, which freed him and his work from certain mundane constraints germane to prior timber construction. In one sense, then, the preservation of the triglyph in this ornamental scheme would have demonstrated very clearly to the Greek onlooker that the new architecture had achieved something altogether tangible, visible in the tiniest details of the design. That achievement would have required, of course, a measure of grammar—so to speak. Therefore can we start to see those elements of Doric ornament which seem so obviously skeumorphic, together with those that so curiously do not. At the bottom there is a canonical microcosmic form, and working up from there, the architect does as much as he can, and the gods will forgive him his humanity.\n\n \n\nBut for modern academics, who we may say for lack of a better word bring with them a certain industrial prejudice, the Doric invention must—above all else—be supplied with a fundamentally practical raison d’etree. It must have occurred commensurate with the way that we ourselves see the world; as a succession of evolutionary inevitabilities, and thus, the material record must contain hybrid forms, as though the architects of antiquity were borne along in some immutable and ergonomic current, where concerns of the engineer were highest, and the limits of his technological capabilities marked the boundary of archaic superstition. Dorpfeld and others therefore convinced themselves that the Heraion must be just such a fossil. Half man, and half beast, thus subverting Vitruvius’s symbolic theory, by purporting to prove it positivistically; that man descended from beast according to a quantifiable mechanism.\n\n \n\nThe Irony of course is that Dorpfeld’s conviction, that the Doric temple’s lineage did extend so far back as the Bronze Age, is true. The issue is that what links the Doric invention to the Megaron, and before, as I’ve discussed elsewhere, to the domicile itself, is a metaphysical lineage. Not a structural one. It’s a symbolic heritage, not an ergonomic one.\n\n \n\nGiven this, we turn briefly to the notorious passage from Pausanias, a Roman chronicler and writer of the first century AD, who described the Heraion on his visit to Olympia. He writes:\n\n \n\nIt remains after this for me to describe the temple of Hera and the noteworthy objects contained in it. The Elean account says that it was the people of Scillus, one of the cities in Triphylia, who built the temple about eight years after Oxylus came to the throne of Elis. The style of the temple is Doric, and pillars stand all round it. In the rear chamber one of the two pillars is of oak. The length of the temple is one hundred and sixty-nine feet, the breadth sixty-three feet, the height not short of fifty feet. Who the architect was they do not relate.\n\n \n\nReading this passage, many modern scholars have delighted to argue that Pausanias meant the peristyle, in that time even still, remained in a state of partial wood and partial stone. Some more sober voices point out that Pausanias was likely describing votive pillars set up within the opisthodomos—which is not at all unprecedented. The response, from the dissent, tends to be that Pausanias was very clearly enamored of objects of great antiquity. Often, he would go out of his way to describe in lavish detail the history and appearance of objects that he knew to be very old. He was, after all, an antiquarian. Therefore, if he meant votive pillars, he would have told us about them in exhaustive detail. Because he didn’t we can assume he meant that the peristyle contained wooden columns itself. The problem is that this argument is neither conclusive nor even particularly convincing. Pausanias described, for example, the image of Apollo at the Amyklaean throne near Sparta—a votive pillar of considerable antiquity, only insofar as to say that he found the thing crude compared to the work of the architect Bathykles, in whose temple the image was housed. Pausanias in that case spared far more words in praise of Bathykles and his architecture, than for the antique pillar of Apollo. This back and forth can persist ad nauseam.\n\n \n\nWhat’s critical to understand is simply that Pausanias is not particularly clear, and therefore, it’s hard to say conclusively what he meant. The reader must ask himself: Is it more likely that in saying “In the rear chamber, one of the two pillars is of oak,” Pausanias meant that there were two votive pillars within the opisthodomos, or, is it more likely that he meant that the temple itself was built of a patchwork of timber and stone from some reason? In his 2016 study of the building, Dr. Phil Sapirstein pointed out that the operative word in this passage, (eteros) could reasonably be taken so broadly as to mean “any column that is distinguished from the rest by being wooden.” We are left, then, with the most substantive issue: That of the variance in the peristyle. Why?\n\n \n\nThe most convincing solution to the riddle of the Heraion’s peristyle is altogether rather simple. But, in order to appreciate the simplicity of the proposal, the reader will first need to take care to become familiar with some elementary concerns that faced the Doric architect—both structural, and proportional. Exiting the dark ages and dispensing with impermanent materials for his work, the architect faced two major challenges. The first was learning to build in stone, and the second was building at a larger scale. What we can uncover by considering the design of a given temple in the context of the architect’s attitude toward these two issues, provides a clarity that is difficult to gather in a purely archaeological setting.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nSimple Structural Concerns in Stone\n\n \n\nThere are five primary ‘loads,’ or forces which may act upon a given structural member. They are compression, tension, bending, torsion, and shear. Compression results when two pushing loads effect an object, squeezing it toward a center point. One stone resting atop another places the bottom stone in compression. Tension results when two pulling forces effect an object, stretching it away from a center point. A rope pulled at both ends thus experiences tension. Bending results when a load is applied to a fixed object, resulting in a deflection or deformation—such as a lintel beam above a door or window, supporting the weight of the wall overhead. When an object experiences bending, the deformation pattern will create a gradient across the object, from compression at one extremity to tension at the other. Torsion and shear are of little consequence here.\n\n \n\nAny span is thus under constant bending pressure—like a single architrave block lofted across two columns in a temple peristyle. It is important to note that a structural member’s resistance to the bending force is dictated by its cross-sectional area.\n\n \n\nGiven this information, consider an ancient architect attempting to enlarge the scale of a monumental structure. If the building in question was simply, say, to double in size, one can imagine a myriad of problems suddenly arise. Quarrying blocks that are twice as large will increase the cost of labour. Blocks of such a size would be drastically more skill-intensive to cut free of the quarry without any cracking, and would have a much greater chance of containing natural fissures that destroy the block upon extraction regardless of the skill of the mason. Doubling the size of the block also presents problems for transporting it, both technologically as well as in cost. Transporting larger blocks from a technological standpoint is something that is addressed and well-documented in the case of the second Artemision at Ephesos, for example, in the mid-6th century. Further, raising blocks of such a size would likely not have been technologically feasible. Not at least at the outset of the masonic task. Still, there is the central issue of structural integrity raised, when increasing the scale of the stone members. \n\n \n\nAs the scale of the temple is increased, so too is the load on both the architrave and the peristyle. The architrave, which comprises individual blocks spanning the intercolumniation, is supporting both the entablature, and its own weight. Different materials will have different properties with respect to the five principle loads outlined above. Stone, for example, is excellent in compression, and brittle in tension. Structures which subject critical stone members to tensile forces will doubtlessly result in catastrophe. “Doubling the size of the architrave,” explains J. J. Coulton, “will mean doubling the length of the architrave as well as its height and thickness.” The relationship of scale to volume is therefore such, that doubling the scale of a block will increase its cross-sectional area by four times, but its volume by eight times.\n\n \n\nWhat this means is that increasing the scale of the temple proportionally will quickly become a question of diminishing structural returns, as the architrave blocks become too heavy to support their own weight—much less the entablature and roof above. Put simply, The weight of the block increases faster than its size. Therefore there exists an upper limit, at which a stone of a given size will crack due to the tensile forces along their underside. When that assembly fails, the temple’s roof will collapse. Many of the design decisions made by Doric architects can be understood as inventive responses to these simple, critical issues.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nCombating Disproportionate Architecture\n\n \n\nFor these reasons it appears that early Doric architects elected to experiment with disproportionately increasing the scale of the building. There are several major ways that this was achieved that we observe archaeologically. The first being, increasing only the length of the temple in plan. Such temples grow longer, but, retain the typical six-column width. \n\n \n\nIt’s a simple, if inelegant solution to the demand for an increase in scale. Throughout most of the 7th century we find that relatively elongated, narrow temples are numerous. While stretching the temple in one dimension does result in a technically larger construction, and conveniently sidesteps the structural problems implicit in widening the temple (and thereby elongating its roof span), the proportion of the overall structure is entirely sacrificed by simply extending it lengthwise. Though it may be harsh to say the practice betrays the relative skill of the architect, it is certainly a sign of the times. This strategy is an early innovation, and eventually gives way to more sophisticated solutions. By the beginning of the classical period, the most common relationship exhibited by temples of the type in terms of its planar proportion was roughly n by (2n + 1), where the variable represents the number of columns in the peristyle along the short facade.\n\n \n\nThe second method employed by architects to navigate the problem of scale was to increase the structure’s length in both planar dimensions. What this means, in structural terms, is the addition of more columns to both facades in order to maintain the optimal intercolumniation—which is dictated by the size of the architrave blocks that span overhead. Recall, the architrave supports the thrust of the roof, and those blocks can only become so large before they fail under their own weight. It’s imperative to keep the spacing between the columns carefully controlled. This results in a more proper ratio of length to width, and again, a technically larger structure. However, the height of a Doric column is a function of its diameter. Though adding more columns to the peristyle can again conveniently sidestep any structural calamity, it is very difficult to alter the height of a Doric column without adjusting the intercolumniation; the temple becomes longer and wider, but alas, no taller. Thus we can understand the strange squatness of the “Basilica” at Paestum. \n\n \n\nIncreasing the temple’s width means a larger roof span, as we’ve said, and that brings along its own set of design problems. For this reason, we ought to pay attention to the number of subdivisions of a temple’s width. The Basilica at Paestum is a somewhat crude example of strategically increasing the number of those subdivisions, and thereby segmenting a larger roof span into more manageable sub-spans. At Paestum the roof span—though widened—is pared down into five points of support, or, four smaller spans. This is achieved with the introduction of the central colonnade in the cella.\n\n \n\nIronically such a configuration sets the Basilica back some two hundred years, reviving old problems exhibited at the Hekatompedon at Samos—that is, the existence of a central colonnade displaces the cult image from the center in the cella. This means that one’s view of the cult image is obstructed, and its position in the temple is disproportionate in the extreme.\n\n \n\nIn fact, the Basilica’s awkward resolution is the origin of its namesake; the Basilica is so-called due to a long-time misconception about its supposed function being non-religious. Originally, the structure was thought not to be a temple at all, but to be some sort of a civic space—a Basilica, because an odd number of columns on the facade meant that there could be no cult image in the proper seat, and further, that the central aperture in the cella was obstructed such that according to legend, the god could not enter the space on-axis. By these assessments, the temple was regarded by archaeologists-of-old as not a temple at all. This misconception persisted for so long that a neoclassical architect in France adapted the Basilica’s plan as a typological model for the Bibliotheque St. Genevieve—contending that the central colonnade allowed for a more functionally appropriate public space in a classical sense. He pointed to the Basilica at Paestum as evidence for this view. The argument was well-received by his contemporaries. The Basilica is thus a fantastic example of the perils of adding more columns to the Doric peristyle in order to increase the building’s size, while avoiding the material limitations of the architrave.\n\n \n\nRecall that the height constraint exhibited by buildings like the Basilica is largely a function of the proportioning system underlying the Doric order. The introduction of the Ionic Order brings a taller column to the stylobate, and as a result the standard six-column facade of the Doric temple is replaced by the typical eight-column front of the Ionic. While the development of the Ionic Order cannot readily be reduced to a direct reaction to this particular set of design problems, it should be noted that the Ionic does, as a matter of fact, re-tool the entire proportioning system underlying the Doric typology, in such a way as to alleviate the height issue to an appreciable degree. For the purposes of this specific discussion we might observe that the Ionic Order operates to increase the number of columns in the peristyle, as well as to increase the height of the architrave—reforming the temple type to a more appropriate proportion at a larger scale—all while retaining a standard block size that is much the same.\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n\nThe Heraion’s Peristyle\n\n \n\nAll of this talk of proportional and structural back-and-forth serves to clarify one single point to the reader, before all else: That despite the rigorous aesthetic of the traditional canona, no two Greek temples are the same. Despite the fact that any two people have hands which conform to the same bone-structure, the same musculature, exhibit the same range of motion, and so on—no two hands have the same configuration of lineaments in the palm. No two sets of fingerprints are the same. So it is with the canon. We must understand that every expression of architectural symbolism in the ancient world were negotiations between the ideal, ouranic manner evident in the world around us, and the mundane constraints placed upon the shoulders of the architect. The architect's task, after all, is the reckoning of divine order into the temple. And so, each architect proceeded as best he could, toward that goal, given what was at his disposal. Always for him the quality of his temple was defined by its adherence to, and exemplification of the natural law. His tools, techniques, and technologies were in service of that purpose.\n\n \n\nBearing this in mind, we return to the question of the Heraion and its eccentric peristyle. The simplest explanation for the patchwork aesthetic is that the columns and their capitals were erected at once, together with the rest of the temple, in a single period and according to deliberate intention. One may protest, if that’s the case, then why do we only see such a quilt of columns at the Heraion, and nowhere else in the Greek world? The answer is that we see numerous innovations in the Doric canon that occurred only at one site, and nowhere else.\n\n \n\nThe Temple of Zeus Akragas, for example, sought to skirt the issue of limitation on the scale of the architrave blocks by incorporating a colossal two-courses. This was neither precedented nor repeated. The architect of the Basilica at Paestum, as we’ve seen in detail here, was content to displace the cult image in his temple in order to achieve a larger and more grand structure overall. That central colonnade was apparently so disharmonious to later architects, that it was not repeated either. One wonders then, given the degree of innovation that characterizes the young Doric architect, if the peristyle at the Heraion may be seen according to the same rationale—is there a world where such variance in columns and their capitals made sense as a way to alleviate these practical issues, while at the same time being for the architect an allowable concession—one that arguably did not infringe on the temple’s metaphysical function? It seems that there is. The answer lay in the quarry, and in construction sequencing.\n\n \n\nThe stone at Olympia is of relatively poor quality. Likely sourced from near the river, it’s porous and soft. It’s not like the great Penteli quarries at Athens, where the marble can be won from the earth in unfissured monoliths of exquisite regularity. Both the low character of the stone at Olympia, and the youth of the mason’s craft at the time of the Heraion’s construction, mean that what blocks were able to be produced by a foreman and his workers, from the quarries, was a limiting factor. A given budget could only pay so many laborers, to dig for so long.\n\n \n\nSo, foremost in the architect’s mind were those elements in his temple, which must be allotted the larger, rarer, and more difficult-to-source stones. As we’ve seen, the most crucial elements are the architrave blocks. It’s these, which cannot be configured of variable pieces, like the column drums, and without which, the roof is impossible. They must be large enough to span the intercolumniation, and further, they are the last stone elements to be set into place before the roof is constructed, following the capitals themselves—and this is the key.\n\n \n\nAs the design and construction proceeded, first would be laid the leveling courses, the stereobates, and the stylobate. Atop these, next, would be established the peristyle either in-part, or in whole. Unfinished, the plan of the cella would then be measured out from the peristyle. Any damage that occurred to the colonnade during the process of establishing the cella (by dragging orthostates between column drums) could be dressed away, afterward. All the while, the masons in the quarry are digging up less-desirable stones, pursuing from that fissured mess blocks that were large enough, and substantial enough to serve the architrave. Quarrying would have to continue until the entire architrave was supplied. In such low-quality quarries where the vast majority of what is cut is insufficient, the entire quarrying process could perhaps be viewed as the pursuit of those members. As other blocks were won and set aside, the architect could identify stones suitable for column drums, for the stereobates or stylobate, and so on and so forth. Slowly, the peristyle rises to the level of the capitals.\n\n \n\nIt’s not difficult to imagine that after finally accruing the material for his architrave, the architect of the Heraion would have had, at his disposal, a field of smaller blocks already brought from the quarry. Rather than continuing to push off the schedule, and continuing to pay laborers to keep pursuing more regular stones for the capitals—there at the end of the stonecutting process— perhaps he elected instead to use what was already dug up, and laid out before him. In this way, the variance not just in the height of column drums, but also in the form of the capitals themselves is easily explained.\n\n \n\nVariable drum height is common in Doric temples, likely for this very reason. At the Temple of Athena at Paestum we see it, as well at the Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassai, at the temple of Poseidon at Sounion, the list goes on and on. In-passing it serves to propose an explanation of the Greek columnar flutes, which I’ve not seen elsewhere, for my part. That is, that the flutes on the Doric column are not applied—as is commonly repeated—to ‘hide the horizontal seams’ between drums, and thus give the false impression that the column is a monolithic block of stone. Any observer can see for themselves the horizontal seams in fluted columns, nearer than a dozen strides. No, the flutes are, I suggest, applied toward a slightly more specific purpose. They function, I believe, to hide the horizontal variance in drum height. At a distance, of course the impression of a monolithic column is created, which is desirable, but also, even up-close, it can be difficult to ascertain differences in drum-height that would be quite noticeable without them. Only the most dramatic variance would stick-out, as it were, from the veil of ornamentation. It follows, then, to suggest that the concave character of the flutes, unique to the Greeks, is due to the fact that a concave flute casts a deeper shadow, and therefore, hides the variance more thoroughly in a variety of light conditions. Where the flutes convex, like the Egyptian manner, the bowed-out body of the flute would expose the variable seams much more visibly.\n\n \n\nRegardless, what we see now according to this rationale is that there is no need for multiple construction periods at the Heraion. There is no need for competing stylistic imperatives, no need to attenuate Pausanias, and no need to suddenly twist the words of Vitruvius. For his capitals, the architect at the Heraion appears to have taken what he had at his disposal, and applied the rules of proportion to the raw material of each capital, in its turn, to free a form from the rough stone that suited it. Each stone, itself, being arguably no more ‘variable’ or ‘different’ than the drums and components that comprised its shaft. Unfortunately for him, the odd aesthetic legacy of that compromise was relegated to other experimental solutions, which were neither precedented, nor repeated."

  "content": "There is a valley in South England remote from ambition and from fear, where the passage of strangers is rare and unperceived, and where the scent of the grass in summer is breathed only by those who are native to that unvisited land. The roads to the Channel do not traverse it; they choose upon either side easier passes over the range. One track alone leads up through it to the hills, and this is changeable: now green where men have little occasion to go, now a good road where it nears the homesteads and the barns. The woods grow steep above the slopes; they reach sometimes the very summit of the heights, or, when they cannot attain them, fill in and clothe the coombes. And, in between, along the floor of the valley, deep pastures and their silence are bordered by lawns of chalky grass and the small yew trees of the Downs.\n\n \n\nThe clouds that visit its sky reveal themselves beyond the one great rise, and sail, white and enormous, to the other, and sink beyond that other. But the plains above which they have traveled and the Weald to which they go, the people of the valley cannot see and hardly recall. The wind, when it reaches such fields, is no longer a gale from the salt, but fruitful and soft, an inland breeze; and those whose blood was nourished here feel in that wind the fruitfulness of our orchards and all the life that all things draw from the air.\n\n \n\nIn this place, when I was a boy, I pushed through a fringe of beeches that made a complete screen between me and the world, and I came to a glade called No Man's Land. I climbed beyond it, and I was surprised and glad, because from the ridge of that glade, I saw the sea. To this place very lately I returned.\n\n \n\nThe many things that I recovered as I came up the countryside were not less charming than when a distant memory had enshrined them, but much more. Whatever veil is thrown by a longing recollection had not intensified nor even made more mysterious the beauty of that happy ground; not in my very dreams of morning had I, in exile, seen it more beloved or more rare. Much also that I had forgotten now returned to me as I approached—a group of elms, a little turn of the parson's wall, a small paddock beyond the graveyard close, cherished by one man, with a low wall of very old stone guarding it all round. And all these things fulfilled and amplified my delight, till even the good vision of the place, which I had kept so many years, left me and was replaced by its better reality. \"Here,\" I said to myself, \"is a symbol of what some say is reserved for the soul: pleasure of a kind which cannot be imagined save in a moment when at last it is attained.\"\n\n \n\nWhen I came to my own gate and my own field, and had before me the house I knew, I looked around a little (though it was already evening), and I saw that the grass was standing as it should stand when it is ready for the scythe. For in this, as in everything that a man can do—of those things at least which are very old—there is an exact moment when they are done best. And it has been remarked of whatever rules us that it works blunderingly, seeing that the good things given to a man are not given at the precise moment when they would have filled him with delight. But, whether this be true or false, we can choose the just turn of the seasons in everything we do of our own will, and especially in the making of hay. Many think that hay is best made when the grass is thickest; and so they delay until it is rank and in flower, and has already heavily pulled the ground. And there is another false reason for delay, which is wet weather. For very few will understand (though it comes year after year) that we have rain always in South England between the sickle and the scythe, or say just after the weeks of east wind are over. First we have a week of sudden warmth, as though the south had come to see us all; then we have the weeks of east and south-east wind; and then we have more or less of that rain of which I spoke, and which always astonishes the world. Now it is just before, or during, or at the very end of that rain—but not later—that grass should be cut for hay. True, upland grass, which is always thin, should be cut earlier than the grass in the bottoms and along the water meadows; but not even the latest, even in the wettest seasons, should be left (as it is) to flower and even to seed. For what we get when we store our grass is not a harvest of something ripe, but a thing just caught in its prime before maturity: as witness that our corn and straw are best yellow, but our hay is best green. So also Death should be represented with a scythe and Time with a sickle; for Time can take only what is ripe, but Death comes always too soon. In a word, then, it is always much easier to cut grass too late than too early; and I, under that evening and come back to these pleasant fields, looked at the grass and knew that it was time. June was in full advance; it was the beginning of that season when the night has already lost her foothold of the earth and hovers over it, never quite descending, but mixing sunset with the dawn.\n\n \n\nNext morning, before it was yet broad day, I awoke, and thought of the mowing. The birds were already chattering in the trees beside my window, all except the nightingale, which had left and flown away to the Weald, where he sings all summer by day as well as by night in the oaks and the hazel spinneys, and especially along the little river Adur, one of the rivers of the Weald. The birds and the thought of the mowing had awakened me, and I went down the stairs and along the stone floors to where I could find a scythe; and when I took it from its nail, I remembered how, fourteen years ago, I had last gone out with my scythe, just so, into the fields at morning. In between that day and this were many things, cities and armies, and a confusion of books, mountains and the desert, and horrible great breadths of sea.\n\n \n\nWhen I got out into the long grass the sun was not yet risen, but there were already many colors in the eastern sky, and I made haste to sharpen my scythe, so that I might get to the cutting before the dew should dry. Some say that it is best to wait till all the dew has risen, so as to get the grass quite dry from the very first. But, though it is an advantage to get the grass quite dry, yet it is not worth while to wait till the dew has risen. For, in the first place, you lose many hours of work (and those the coolest), and next—which is more important—you lose that great ease and thickness in cutting which comes of the dew. So I at once began to sharpen my scythe.\n\n \n\nThere is an art also in the sharpening of the scythe, and it is worth describing carefully. Your blade must be dry, and that is why you will see men rubbing the scythe-blade with grass before they whet it. Then also your rubber must be quite dry, and on this account it is a good thing to lay it on your coat and keep it there during all your day's mowing. The scythe you stand upright, with the blade pointing away from you, and put your left hand firmly on the back of the blade, grasping it: then you pass the rubber first down one side of the blade-edge and then down the other, beginning near the handle and going on to the point and working quickly and hard. When you first do this you will, perhaps, cut your hand; but it is only at first that such an accident will happen to you.\n\n \n\nTo tell when the scythe is sharp enough this is the rule. First the stone clangs and grinds against the iron harshly; then it rings musically to one note; then, at last, it purrs as though the iron and stone were exactly suited. When you hear this, your scythe is sharp enough; and I, when I heard it that June dawn, with everything quite silent except the birds, let down the scythe and bent myself to mow.\n\n \n\nWhen one does anything anew, after so many years, one fears very much for one's trick or habit. But all things once learnt are easily recoverable, and I very soon recovered the swing and power of the mower. Mowing well and mowing badly—or rather not mowing at all—are separated by very little; as is also true of writing verse, of playing the fiddle, and of dozens of other things, but of nothing more than of believing. For the bad or young or untaught mower without tradition, the mower Promethean, the mower original and contemptuous of the past, does all these things: He leaves great crescents of grass uncut. He digs the point of the scythe hard into the ground with a jerk. He loosens the handles and even the fastening of the blade. He twists the blade with his blunders, he blunts the blade, he chips it, dulls it, or breaks it clean off at the tip. If any one is standing by he cuts him in the ankle. He sweeps up into the air wildly, with nothing to resist his stroke. He drags up earth with the grass, which is like making the meadow bleed. But the good mower who does things just as they should be done and have been for a hundred thousand years, falls into none of these fooleries. He goes forward very steadily, his scythe-blade just barely missing the ground, every grass falling; the swish and rhythm of his mowing are always the same.\n\n \n\nSo great an art can only be learnt by continual practice; but this much is worth writing down, that, as in all good work, to know the thing with which you work is the core of the affair. Good verse is best written on good paper with an easy pen, not with a lump of coal on a whitewashed wall. The pen thinks for you; and so does the scythe mow for you if you treat it honorably and in a manner that makes it recognize its service. The manner is this. You must regard the scythe as a pendulum that swings, not as a knife that cuts. A good mower puts no more strength into his stroke than into his lifting. Again, stand up to your work. The bad mower, eager and full of pain, leans forward and tries to force the scythe through the grass. The good mower, serene and able, stands as nearly straight as the shape of the scythe will let him, and follows up every stroke closely, moving his left foot forward. Then also let every stroke get well away. Mowing is a thing of ample gestures, like drawing a cartoon. Then, again, get yourself into a mechanical and repetitive mood: be thinking of anything at all but your mowing, and be anxious only when there seems some interruption to the monotony of the sound. In this mowing should be like one's prayers—all of a sort and always the same, and so made that you can establish a monotony and work them, as it were, with half your mind: that happier half, the half that does not bother.\n\n \n\nIn this way, when I had recovered the art after so many years, I went forward over the field, cutting lane after lane through the grass, and bringing out its most secret essences with the sweep of the scythe until the air was full of odors. At the end of every lane I sharpened my scythe and looked back at the work done, and then carried my scythe down again upon my shoulder to begin another. So, long before the bell rang in the chapel above me—that is, long before six o'clock, which is the time for the Angelus—I had many swathes already lying in order parallel like soldiery; and the high grass yet standing, making a great contrast with the shaven part, looked dense and high. As it says in the Ballad of Val-ès-Dunes, where—\n\n \n\nThe tall sons of the seven winds\n\nCame riding out of Hither-Hythe\n\n \n\nand his horse-hoofs (you will remember) trampled into the press and made a gap in it, and his sword (as you know)\n\n \n\nWas like a scythe\n\nIn Arcus when the grass is high\n\nAnd all the swathes in order lie\n\nAnd there’s the bailiff standing by\n\nA-gathering of the tithe.\n\n \n\nSo I mowed all that morning, till the houses awoke in the valley, and from some of them rose a little fragrant smoke, and men began to be seen.\n\nI stood still and rested on my scythe to watch the awakening of the village, when I saw coming up to my field a man whom I had known in older times, before I had left the Valley.\n\n \n\nHe was of that dark silent race upon which all the learned quarrel, but which, by whatever meaningless name it may be called—Iberian, or Celtic, or what you will—is the permanent root of all England, and makes England wealthy and preserves it everywhere, except perhaps in the Fens and in a part of Yorkshire. Everywhere else you will find it active and strong. These people are intensive; their thoughts and their labors turn inward. It is on account of their presence in these islands that our gardens are the richest in the world. They also love low rooms and ample fires and great warm slopes of thatch. They have, as I believe, an older acquaintance with the English air than any other of all the strains that make up England. They hunted in the Weald with stones, and camped in the pines of the green-sand. They lurked under the oaks of the upper rivers, and saw the legionaries go up, up the straight paved road from the sea. They helped the few pirates to destroy the towns, and mixed with those pirates and shared the spoils of the Roman villas, and were glad to see the captains and the priests destroyed. They remain; and no admixture of the Frisian pirates, or the Breton, or the Angevin and Norman conquerors, has very much affected their cunning eyes.\n\n \n\nTo this race, I say, belonged the man who now approached me. And he said to me, \"Mowing?\" And I answered, \"Ar.\" Then he also said \"Ar,\" as in duty bound; for so we speak to each other in the Stenes of the Downs.\n\n \n\nNext he told me that, as he had nothing to do, he would lend me a hand; and I thanked him warmly, or, as we say, \"kindly.\" For it is a good custom of ours always to treat bargaining as though it were a courteous pastime; and though what he was after was money, and what I wanted was his labor at the least pay, yet we both played the comedy that we were free men, the one granting a grace and the other accepting it. For the dry bones of commerce, avarice and method and need, are odious to the Valley; and we cover them up with a pretty body of fiction and observances. Thus, when it comes to buying pigs, the buyer does not begin to decry the pig and the vendor to praise it, as is the custom with lesser men; but tradition makes them do business in this fashion:—\n\n \n\nFirst the buyer will go up to the seller when he sees him in his own steading, and, looking at the pig with admiration, the buyer will say that rain may or may not fall, or that we shall have snow or thunder, according to the time of the year. Then the seller, looking critically at the pig, will agree that the weather is as his friend maintains. There is no haste at all; great leisure marks the dignity of their exchange. And the next step is, that the buyer says: \"That's a fine pig you have there, Mr. ——\" (giving the seller's name). \"Ar, powerful fine pig.\" Then the seller, saying also \"Mr.\" (for twin brothers rocked in one cradle give each other ceremonious observance here), the seller, I say, admits, as though with reluctance, the strength and beauty of the pig, and falls into deep thought. Then the buyer says, as though moved by a great desire, that he is ready to give so much for the pig, naming half the proper price, or a little less. Then the seller remains in silence for some moments; and at last begins to shake his head slowly, till he says: \"I don't be thinking of selling the pig, anyways.\" He will also add that a party only Wednesday offered him so much for the pig—and he names about double the proper price. Thus all ritual is duly accomplished; and the solemn act is entered upon with reverence and in a spirit of truth. For when the buyer uses this phrase: \"I'll tell you what I will do,\" and offers within half a crown of the pig's value, the seller replies that he can refuse him nothing, and names half a crown above its value; the difference is split, the pig is sold, and in the quiet soul of each runs the peace of something accomplished.\n\n \n\nThus do we buy a pig or land or labor or malt or lime, always with elaboration and set forms; and many a London man has paid double and more for his violence and his greedy haste and very unchivalrous higgling. As happened with the land at Underwaltham, which the mortgagees had begged and implored the estate to take at twelve hundred and had privately offered to all the world at a thousand, but which a sharp direct man, of the kind that makes great fortunes, a man in a motor-car, a man in a fur coat, a man of few words, bought for two thousand three hundred before my very eyes, protesting that they might take his offer or leave it; and all because he did not begin by praising the land.\n\n \n\nWell then, this man I spoke of offered to help me, and he went to get his scythe. But I went into this house and brought out a gallon jar of small ale for him and for me; for the sun was now very warm, and small ale goes well with mowing. When we had drunk some of this ale in mugs called \"I see you,\" we took each a swathe, he a little behind me because he was the better mower; and so for many hours we swung, one before the other, mowing and mowing at the tall grass of the field. And the sun rose to noon and we were still at our mowing; and we ate food, but only for a little while, and we took again to our mowing. And at last there was nothing left but a small square of grass, standing like a square of linesmen who keep their formation, tall and unbroken, with all the dead lying around them when the battle is over and done.\n\n \n\nThen for some little time I rested after all those hours; and the man and I talked together, and a long way off we heard in another field the musical sharpening of a scythe.\n\n \n\nThe sunlight slanted powdered and mellow over the breadth of the valley; for day was nearing its end. I went to fetch rakes from the steading; and when I had come back the last of the grass had fallen, and all the field lay flat and smooth, with the very green short grass in lanes between the dead and yellow swathes.\n\n \n\nThese swathes we raked into cocks to keep them from the dew against our return at daybreak; and we made the cocks as tall and steep as we could, for in that shape they best keep off the dew, and it is easier also to spread them after the sun has risen. Then we raked up every straggling blade, till the whole field was a clean floor for the tedding and the carrying of the hay next morning. The grass we had mown was but a little over two acres; for that is all the pasture on my little tiny farm.\n\n \n\nWhen we had done all this, there fell upon us the beneficent and deliberate evening; so that as we sat a little while together near the rakes, we saw the valley more solemn and dim around us, and all the trees and hedgerows quite still, and held by a complete silence. Then I paid my companion his wage, and bade him a good night, till we should meet in the same place before sunrise.\n\n \n\nHe went off with a slow and steady progress, as all our peasants do, making their walking a part of the easy but continual labor of their lives. But I sat on, watching the light creep around towards the north and change, and the waning moon coming up as though by stealth behind the woods of No Man's Land."

  "content": "In nature’s wonderful economy everyone and everything has its place and blessed is the person who finds his place in the plan. Each individual has a work to do, no two alike, each one purely individual, purely self-supporting, spiritually if not physically, but each one dependent to a certain degree upon the fact that they realize that they will be supported or at least proper environments built around them through the cooperative, coadjunction of their fellow creatures. The success of the entire plan of any great organization depends upon the working of each unit and many a great organization has gone to pieces through the lack of cooperation of one minute unit. It is the same in all works, whether they be spiritual, philosophical, or material. A perfect understanding of our own position, a willingness to acquiesce and give a little that the entire may go on more smoothly, a readiness to recognize superiority whether it be in quoting Scripture or driving rivets, all these things should be in the consciousness of individuals. They should realized that no matter how great or how small they may be, they have their place and the fact that they are existing at all is proof certain that they are, in part at least filling their appointed position; and their greatest glory should not be to fill other peoples’ shoes but to be worthy examples of having lived up to and properly carried on the labors of their own life.\n\n​\n\nIn spiritual enterprises two great problems are confronted which ofttimes inhibit, thorough no directly malicious means but rather through thoughtlessness and ignorance, the success of the entire. The first is the way in which the teacher views his pupil or followers; and the second is how the followers view and consider the teacher. In this article we are going to take up that problem in as simple a way as possible, hoping that it will assist in the removing of difficulties in some lives and bring a more fundamental realization of the oneness of things and of the close proximity of the Ideal to the real.\n\n​\n\nFirst of all, let us take up the teacher and his position in distinction to his students’ and analyze the instructor’s place in the great plan; how he should fill it and what motive should inspire him.\n\n \n\n1\n\nA teacher is one who, feeling that his own experience, study or research has revealed certain ideals, theories or truths to his own consciousness, desires to communicate these to others whose lives, thoughts, and ideals have not made possible their first-hand understanding of the particular thing which he has investigated.\n\n \n\n2\n\nA teacher of spiritual truth is no better, greater or more privileged than the least of his students but is merely endeavoring to promulgate certain facts which have come under his inspection that he may spread knowledge, spirituality or philosophy, and dispel ignorance which is eternally combating and limiting man’s growth and narrowing his viewpoint of life. A teacher in the public schools whose specialty is arithmetic is not made of any better sod than the pupils who receive his or her instruction but is merely one qualified to inform them of certain things which when they learn them and apply them will make them equally great in that thing with their instructor. Any teacher who expresses through their thoughts, actions or ideas a feeling of superiority, of loftiness, and great distance from the common herd, have removed all opportunity to really teach humanity, for, like the teacher in the common schools, his or her success depends upon winning and deserving the confidence of the pupils.\n\n \n\n3\n\nNo honest teacher of spiritual philosophy who knows enough to understand its principles ever places the possessive thought or word upon whatever knowledge he may possess. The real teacher knows that he is only an instrument and that while he may instruct some he must still in childish simplicity seek instruction himself. When the instructor forgets this and fails to realize that only those who have learned to take orders are worthy to give them, he loses his opportunity for spiritual greatness.\n\n \n\n4\n\nThe teacher should try in his life and habits to express the truths which he believes in, for if he does not try to profit by them himself he cannot expect other mortals to seek to learn them. When he fails to bow beneath the law that he advocates for another he leaves the impression in the mind of the world that he believes himself to be greater than the law, and no real teacher can even for a moment hold such a thought.\n\n \n\n5\n\nThose who are truly great are those who are truly simple and those doctrines which help the world the most come in simple words from simple people of simple lives, and their plainness and purity gives them a power which verbosity can never impart. The greater the teacher the less conspicuous, the less assertive, he will be, for he realizes that a battle won with dissension is a battle lost.\n\n \n\n6\n\nA person in the position of a teacher, who is gifted in some way, has perhaps won the respect of admiring followers. If he then abuses that respect or uses it for the gratification of selfishness or egotism or prostitutes it by using it as a blind for the furtherance of some other specific end, such a person is unfit to associate with decent people and is a disgrace to any teaching that he may represent. The true teacher has no strings upon his teaching, they are what they seem to be and he is what he seems to be. When this is not the case, beware, for there is little to learn and much to lose by becoming involved in teachings based upon secretiveness, darkness and hidden things. The masters of light do not work in such ways.\n\n \n\n7\n\nA teacher has no right to demand respect or confidence, he has no right to demand that others serve him, take care of his needs, nor has he the privilege of claiming a reward for his works. His is the privilege to labor, the greatest privilege in all the universe; the privilege of those he helps is to assist him, and when the teacher and the student work together, in spirit and in truth, a bond is built between them which no power of man can sever.\n\n \n\n8\n\nThe true teacher claims nothing, professes nothing, but lets his works express his power. Those who are always telling of their various accomplishments do so because no one else has perceived anything to talk about. Those who know, need not tell it, for their thoughts, their actions and their lives are the proof of their knowledge and that proof speaks louder and more tangibly than any word of theirs. The sweetness and benevolence which marks the master needs no words to describe it. It is a balm of Gilead to all whom he meets and man and beast alike love him for what he is, not what he says he is. The masters speak not for themselves but for others. Nor do they claim to be the omnipotent messengers of the divine. They just serve mankind and let the world judge the value of their works.\n\n \n\n9\n\nThe teacher who in his teaching forgets that he himself is a student does not go far, for the master knows that in everyone he speaks to there is a lesson that he does not know and that every listener who attends his speeches knows something that he has not learned. Therefore, regardless of who it is, the teacher should listen to the simplest of his pupils for words of truth which the soul of the master alone can comprehend.\n\n \n\n10\n\nThe teacher must not be egotistic. Flattery lurks like a venomous serpent to destroy those who are before the eyes of the world. Mushy people gush over the teacher and fall upon his neck to weep. He is told that he is the god incarnate, that he is a master and the greatest that has ever existed, and many other similar things. If he listens to these and believes them, he is lost beyond recall. The master judges the ignorance which gives birth in the minds of others to such thoughts, realizing that only his God knows what he really is. Thousands of wonderful workers in the vineyards of the Lord have been ruined by the worship and adoration of their followers which has turned their heads until they really think they are something important. Let the teachers beware of this danger for it is more subtle than the serpent and more deadly than hemlock.\n\n \n\n11\n\nA teacher of truth must not try to please the world, for the world is only pleased when follies are recommended or vices excused. The teacher must realize that unless he teaches that which rings true to his own realization he is unfit to claim discipleship for knowledge. Please not man, but God, and your own higher self.\n\n \n\nWherever truth goes and man seeks to open the closed eyes of his brothers, he will be fought by those who do not wish to see. Let him not be discouraged in his work for he is but a disciple of his Christ and they nailed that Master to the tree. Can the student expect a better fate, for surely the disciple is not greater than his master. They stoned the prophets and cast them into the arena and burned them in Nero’s gardens, and in every religion of the world the teacher is persecuted; therefore be glad, the persecution shows that you have done something worth doing, for if all men liked you it would prove that you were a slave to vice and not virtue as the world loves vice alone and is thoughtless unto death.\n\n \n\nBut the true teacher works for the work alone not for applause or public acclaim. The drainman wins the glory that the seer will never know. The master does the work his students will not do, cleans out the dark and smutty places while those more gentile receive the plaudits of the world. But those who work for glory, work to no avail, for today they glorify and tomorrow they crucify… that is the thankfulness of a thoughtless people. The master works that the generations to come shall not suffer from that thoughtlessness.\n\n​\n\n12\n\nThe teacher never blames, for he realizes that it is not in his power to judge. He helps and instructs when he can, but will not condemn the one who condemns him, always forgiving even though his life shall be the forfeit. By this he is known to all humanity as one who is striving to reach the state of conscious union with the divine.\n\n \n\n13\n\nThe harmless life of the Master has won for him the confidence of all things who love him for the sweetness of his soul, the broadness of his vision, the depth of his thought, the softness of his heart, and the strength of his hand. And as the teacher today seeks to follow in the footsteps of those divine ones of old, let him too realize that the teacher’s work for the pupil is to live for him, to help him to grow and to do the best that is in him, and that the joy of the master is in selflessness.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nWhat a Pupil Should Be\n\n​\n\nAs the master has his duties to man, so man has his duties to those who seek to serve in whatsoever way they can. In this day when the world is filled with dishonesty and religion cloaks many a scoundrel beneath the shelter of a holy name, we cannot blame people for being suspicious, of doubting and fearing. But the pupil is not privileged to doubt, for he knows that all things are of God in the ultimate. And if he has found the glory of a truth he loves or if he is still uncertain in his choice, still he has certain duties which he must not overlook and which, if not properly shouldered, will bring sorrow and loss to the seeker after spiritual light.\n\n \n\n1\n\nWhere many students gather together there are sure to be conflicting thoughts, some who think one way and some another, and from this is born a great confusion which often destroys harmony and harmony’s death is the ruination of works. The student must remember that when he comes to one whom he believes knows, he is not there to express his opinion or promulgate his philosophy, but to hear that which another has to say. Those who come to argue, to discredit, to tear down, to pick flaws in, and to express their own superiority over the work of a brother creature prove conclusively that they are not students of anything but are merely egotists trying to find someone else to agree with them. People who come with axes to grind and for the sake of what they can get out of it instead of what they can give, will never gain.\n\n \n\n2\n\nPupils who worship their teacher will always lose him. The pupil must work for God, not God’s messenger, and those who make idols shall live to see them crumble while those who live for the ideal shall live to see it prosper. Respect, cooperation and willingness to do the thing that should be done, not in the name of each other but of God, in is the attitude the student should hold.\n\n \n\n3\n\nThe student must be practical and carry his philosophy and religion into his home and his life and apply it to the living problem of existence. We have too many theorists in occultism, too many worshipers of personalities who will serve Jones because they love him but will do nothing for Smith because they do not. All true workers love all work, not only their own but every other, and no student of the Wisdom Religion will tear down a work that is doing good. He will fearlessly unveil fraud, deception and perversion but never out of jealousy and spite will he injure another.\n\n \n\n4\n\nIt ill behooves a student to praise his own work or the philosophy he is in. Let his life praise the work, not his love. His teacher needs no other championing than the regeneration of the pupil. Those who place their teacher upon pedestals and gather around to defend are only burying the one they love under a mountain of fanaticism. The only true way of defending a work is by proving its merit to the world through individual application. He should cooperate with the thing he feels is worthwhile for if it is really of value it is worth applying and if it is not worth applying it is not worth knowing. It is the duty of the student to overcome those things in himself which upset and destroy the beauty of the teaching. Thoughtless gossip, malicious slander, and petty jealousies are the things which have killed every great teacher who has come into the world. They have been worried to death, pestered to death and dunned to death by nothing but a series of unimportant, personal, trivial things in which people who claim to be spiritual and godlike still refuse to give a point or overlook an unimportant trivial. The master brings the truth as he has seen it while the pupil’s duty is to receive it in the same brotherly way that the teacher seeks to give it. For know you that the Truth only lives in the souls of men and the pupil is the one who must decide the fate of the teacher, his master, and his God."

  "content": "Introduction\n\n \n\nIt is only natural that our highest moral aspirations are inseparable from our basest vices. The very depredations inflicted by our untempered impulses, in fact, motivate us to envision a measure of nobility, and to pursue that instead. It was no doubt the savagery of the first tribal tyrants that swelled the empathetic instinct. The oppressed, recognizing the suffering of others who shared their lot, found a single purpose in undoing it. Conflict is often the only means to relieve the pressure of despotism. The first war of ethics then, was their battle for liberation, and our first codes of behavior were the memorial they built to honor that victory. Those across history who have survived war evidently understood that while conflict can never be taken off the table, it can be contained by the respect one must maintain for another, as warriors. So it was that for the warrior castes—despite the martial nature of the arts which defined them—vice became more brutal, and virtue became more noble.\n\n \n\nBecause the warrior castes mediate the boundary between times of war, and times of peace, the martial ethos of a given culture tends to permeate the society in which it originated. It becomes the highest bar of virtue. Examples include concepts like arete for the Greeks, or bushido for the Japanese. Of particular note for the present discussion are the codes of chivalry, which, in some form or other, influenced the behavior of much of Europe for the better part of a millennia. For scholars it remains debatable when exactly the chivalric code was most influential, and indeed, it proves troublesome to lay out all the tenants of the code even for a given place, or time. That there even was an “age of chivalry” at all has become a matter of fashionable question for the sort of academic who assumes a man cannot reasonably venerate one thing, yet only achieve another. It should be no surprise then, that it is impossible to pinpoint the precise moment of origin for the chivalric tradition. Its foundation, as with all highest principles, lay in myth.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nRise and Fall of Chivalry\n\n \n\nChivalry is an anglicized derivation of the French chevalerie, the plural of chevalier which describes a man of enough rank and means to outfit himself for horse-mounted combat. This etymology suits the concept, as the notion of the chivalric ideal is inseparable from the image of Europe’s elite equestrian soldiery. In the aftermath of the fall of the Roman empire, there was an enormous vacuum politically, culturally and militarily which were filled in novel ways. The Roman reliance upon the precision machine of its heavy infantry and its ability to hire local auxilia to resolve any gaps in strategy, was difficult to replicate. The warlords in Europe, or the nobility rather, as the difference is usually down to how long one has been in charge, lacked the infrastructure and means to rally large numbers of professional soldiers or mercenaries. Instead, the bulk of a force would be made up of levied soldiers with only the upper echelons of society having the time and resources to specialize as warriors. As a result, a lord’s retainers were prized for their abilities in war, for their arms, for their armor, for their horses, and their training—each of which embodied an intensive outlay of wealth and land. Rulers were encouraged in-turn to create a noble class, paid in land (coin was rare). This class made up the backbone  of their armies, and served to animate the levies. The result was that an extremely elite cadre of high-society became the spoke around which much of European society turned.\n\n \n\nThe fluid political situation of feudal Europe, especially in those early days near the dawn of the first millennium, created an environment of shifting alliances and of near constant conflict. Even in the rare cases that a war wasn’t on, raiding and border skirmishes were a constant threat. Because the average scale nation state was considerably reduced, the nearest foeman was also often a cultural compatriot—a relation in spirit if not as well in blood. The maintenance of bloodlines across national borders together with intermarriage commonly made the bond all the more literal. Because of these circumstances, a relatively small caste of highly capable men were uniquely positioned to understand and to respect one-another both in united cause and in cross purpose. It was fertile ground for the conceptual development of a creed, which transcended band, clan, and nation. It encompassed their entire way of life. The seeds of such a code were buried well before the fall of Rome. Religious and military life were deeply interwoven, and cults such as that of Sol Invictus, and the Mithraic mysteries enjoyed wide followings in the Roman armed forces. Likewise, numerous warrior cults and martial ideologies—Celtic and Germanic iterations, for example—were also subsumed into the broader cultural tide that became European Christendom. The attitudes and principles of their participants did not fade away at the end of empire, nor were they eclipsed by the meeker, pacifistic tenants of Christianity. Even as the star of Christianity rose in Europe, spirituality remained the medium by which a higher standard of conduct was to be maintained among the newly-reformed warrior caste. It was out of this spiritual and ideological turmoil, butted roughly against the realities of war, that the idea of the knight itself arose.\n\n \n\nThere is in war a natural desire to disdain your foe. To be so far at odds, an enemy must have done you some grievous harm, or else behaved monstrously. Yet, also in war there is, against any real, meaningful foe, a strong pressure to respect the capabilities of your enemies. To do less invites your own destruction at the hands of an under-esteemed antagonist. Attainment of a high martial expertise is a matter of many long hours’ work, and represents the honing of a state of mind over years. When you are matched in maneuver and strength of arms, you recognize in moments how alike you are to your opposition, at least in some vital way. Chivalric codes are born out of this reflexivity, as brothers-in-arms pursuing common glory. A reverence for the prowess of an enemy adds immediately to the glory of overcoming him, or else, softens the blow of dying at his hand. The meeting of empathy and self-service—with the added influence of Christian forbearance and charity—furnished European knights with the impetus of chivalry.\n\n \n\nEarly Medieval knighthood arose in two legendary courts, that of Charlemagne and his Paladins, and that of Arthur and his knights of the round table. Though the former significantly less mythical than the latter, each was held up as exemplary of noble ethos. The Carolingian Cycle and the Historia Regum Britanniae both play out the activities of these courts in the late 7th century, but were themselves put to record centuries later. So it was that each generation of knighthood measured themselves against the previous age, and found themselves wanting compared to the mythical exploits of their forebears. The tenants that compose the ideals of chivalry are not universal, and no book of rules has survived in tact. All that remains to us, and likely to many generations of knights even in those early days, are the stories of laudable actions and damnable knavery which preceded them. In sifting the histories, French historian Léon Gautier was able to distill his findings into what he supposed were the 10 commandments of Chivalry, which follow.\n\n​\n\nThou shalt believe all that the Church teaches and thou shalt observe all its directions.\n\nThou shalt defend the Church.\n\nThou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.\n\nThou shalt love the country in which thou wast born.\n\nThou shalt not recoil before thine enemy.\n\nThou shalt make war against the infidel without cessation and without mercy.\n\nThou shalt perform scrupulously thy feudal duties, if they be not contrary to the laws of God.\n\nThou shalt never lie, and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word.\n\nThou shalt be generous, and give largesse to everyone.\n\nThou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.\n\n \n\nThere are several common currents here. Bravery and unflinching duty are natural to the warrior ethos, but, many of these items extend beyond virtues of particular martial utility. Namely, defending the weak, charity, and the requirement to stand against injustice. What we have in this creed is a commingling of warrior attitudes together with other attitudes that make for a most amenable peace. Consider this passage from La Chanson de Rolandas translated by Léonce Rabillon:\n\n​\n\nCCLXXXIV.\n​\nBoth knights leap on the earth, and, quick as light, Stand face to face.—Strong, fiery Pinabel And Tierri for each other seek. Their steeds Are fled.—But their gold-hilted swords they wield; And on the helms of steel they shower such blows As rashed the thongs. Loudly the knights lament, And Carle exclaims:—\"Show thou the right, O God!\"\n\n \n\nCried Pinabel:—\"Tierri, surrender thou! Thy vassal I will be in faith and love, And to thy pleasure will I yield my wealth; But let the King forgive Count Ganelon!\" Tierri replied:—\"Thy offers all are vain; Vile treason were it such a pact to make; But God shall judge us and make plain the right.\"\n\n \n\nThen Tierri spake:—\"I hold thee, Pinabel, As Baron true, great, strong, of handsome mold; Thy peers acknowledge thee as valiant knight; Well, let this combat cease, between the King And thee a covenant I will strive to make. On Ganelon such justice shall be done That future ages shall record the doom.\" They grasp again their swords and hew Each other's gold-encrusted helm with rage So rash that sparkling fires spurt through the air. No power will now disjoint the combatants: The death of one can only close the strife.\n\n​\n\nWe see that even in the heart of a duel to the death, the two knights’ first thoughts were of honoring one another, and exchanging offers of generosity and magnanimity. They do not shy from their duty or their loyalties but nor do they thoughtlessly seek war or conflict, this is the great virtue of chivalry. Not because adhering to notions of chivalry will avoid conflict, but because it centers conflict upon the greater spiritual ills that afflict us rather than in areas  furthering our vices. As a warrior ethos it strove to confine the costs of war to those places of cultural fiction which can make it inevitable, and see to it that the weighty price could buy something more than martial gains.\n\n \n\nOf course, as with any moral system, even those most dedicated adherents could fall short of chivalric virtue, much less the inevitable blaggards  with no interest in moral works, spiritual cowards who lack the will to enact their convictions and two faced sorts who profess virtue and set about vice. Such humane disparities, which afflict all our best aspirations, has lead some historians to conclude that an age of chivalric virtue never existed. Rather, that it is simply nostalgia for an unreal past; fodder for poets as chastisement for their apathetic and self-serving contemporaries.\n\n \n\nHowever, such a circumstance doesn’t seem to render chivalric virtue any more nebulous than another sort. Materialistic cynicism of that type misunderstands an often unspoken tenant, which is core to the ethos. That is to say, the purpose of a tradition of veneration trained on a bygone era, in which legends were made by nobler men. The figures of such a tradition provision a rule, against which to to measure oneself, which in-turn instills a sense of heritable duty that weighs more than an abstraction of law. Including a passage from the song of Roland, rather than an historical account, is intentional. The legend reveals to the individual some higher aspiration, in his own time, on his own terms—it is not legislated to him whether he likes it or not. The structure of morality, then, is not an implacable stone edifice, but a great tree with its roots in the past; its trunk comprises those meritorious acts put down in legend, and the present moment is lofted among the leaves that waver in the winds of choice.\n\n \n\nBecause access to the corridors of power demands proximity, what intrigue grows up around the powerful was inevitably intermingled—court politics and notions of chivalric behavior overlapping. We see this already in Léon Gautier’s distillation: The importance of feudal duty thrice articulated in nation, lord, and bond. A warrior ethos will always be, first, one that serves, because aimless violence is unjustifiable. Of course, the word knight itself means servant in its older formulations. The more unusual condition is that the high culture of courtly life will be governed in such detail by a code formulated among, or at least for, its fighters. As martial utility was so important to achieve and maintain status, for many centuries knighthood was an essential feature of nobility. This extended even to noncombatants. The priesthood of the Christian faith was closely interwoven with chivalric ideals, and notions of courtly love featured in chivalric literature included contemplation of the feminine ideal. Status then, became somewhat inseparable from chivalric attitudes, or at least from the appearance of them. Knighthood and nobility came to mean much the same thing with few exceptions. Eventually, the code of chivalry, rather than a standard created to bring order among warriors who proved capable or dead in the post-Roman chaos, was just one more expectation of the noble class.\n\n           \n\nAs the ages turned in Europe, the influence and stability of nations naturally grew larger as power became more consolidated in general. The outlay and irregularity of maintaining individual knights as elite troops who managed their own efforts and logistics was outmoded (once again) by the convenience and standardization of full time professional soldiers and mercenaries. Knights went from the decisive component of any army, to a central one, until eventually the knight was absorbed and dissolved into national armies comprising full-time professional soldiers. Concurrently, the nature of nobility was changing. The more entrenched monarchs with more established bureaucracies were able to pay in coin rather than in land. Immediately, the pressure for the noble class to overlap with knighthood, or even with soldiery in general, was dramatically reduced. Of course, the need for the ruling classes to be present in command and control of military structures remained, but, now the highest echelons of society were no longer by any means synonymous with the people who would be responsible for the prosecution of war. Knighthood was diminished to little more than a title of political expedience, no longer a station of martial import.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Warrior Ethos\n\n \n\nIn markets and on battlefields circumstances can change quickly, and dramatically. The motivations and the ideals, especially of a crowd—much less a nation—are considerably less mutable. The influence of chivalric ideas and court manners went well beyond those who would ever actually attend a court, royal or otherwise. The romantic ideas of noble behaviors were transmitted down through the classes and propagated between merchant and peasant classes. The image of virtue was, and is to a great extent even now, chivalric knighthood. And so, many people who might never seek service in arms, nevertheless live according to a moral code based in the ethics of the warrior caste. One particular holdover of that moral system is the practice of dueling.\n\n           \n\nThe notion that single combat between champions might avoid a battle, and allow two rulers to settle a conflict with out great mortal cost to their subjects, is unfortunately wishful. If there is enough motive to move a kingdom to war, the death of one man is unlikely to set the matter aside. However, the practice of single combat before a battle was widespread, and served as a means to achieve great fame by defeating a worthy foe before two hosts of your peers. The ensuing victories and defeats could set the tone for the coming conflict, and perhaps, deal a telling blow to the morale of one side or the other. The point of worthiness is pivotal here, as it demands a recognition of rank and prowess between foes; an inevitable respect, which is earned only in contest. However, trial by combat could be a successful means of reducing bloodshed when two knights, and by extension their retinues, were at odds. What is most just becomes a complicated question when resolution between the aggrieved and accused might involve a mortal skirmish between warbands. In such a case, a disaster was almost ensured—especially if the men involved would both otherwise fight under the same banner, or, if raid and counter-raid could be the first sparks of open war. That the result would be observed and respected was a matter of honor, according to chivalric tradition. Violence in its noblest form is that by which greater harm is averted. We see exactly this mentality put to paper, in Yvain’s legendary duel with Gawain in Chrétien DeTroyes' \"Yvain,” reproduced here at some length for the reader’s interest:\n\n \n\n“...For they strike each other violently, not with the fiat of the swords, but with the edge, and they deal such blows with the pommels upon the nose-guards and upon the neck, forehead and cheeks, that they are all marked black and blue where the blood collects beneath the skin. And their hauberks are so torn, and their shields so broken in pieces, that neither one escaped without wounds…\n\n \n\n…They fight so long that the day draws on to night, while their arms grow weary and their bodies sore, and the hot, boiling blood flows from many a spot and trickles down beneath their hauberks: they are in such distress that it is no wonder if they wish to rest. Then both withdraw to rest themselves, each thinking within himself that, however long he has had to wait, he now at last has met his match. For some time they thus seek repose, without daring to resume the fight…\n\n \n\n...\"I am Yvain, who love you more than any man in the whole wide world, for you have always been fond of me and shown me honour in every court. But I wish to make you such amends and do you such honour in this affair that I will confess myself to have been defeated.\" \"Will you do so much for my sake?\" my gentle lord Gawain asks him; \"surely I should be presumptuous to accept any such amends from you. This honour shall never be claimed as mine, but it shall be yours, to whom I resign it.\" \"Ah, fair sire, do not speak so. For that could never be. I am so wounded and exhausted that I cannot endure more.\" \"Surely, you have no cause to be concerned.\" his friend and companion replies; \"but for my part, I am defeated and overcome; I say it not as a compliment; for there is no stranger in the world, to whom I would not say as much, rather than receive any more blows…\"\n\n \n\nThis poetic account, naturally idealized, nonetheless reveals what is perhaps the deepest hope at the heart of the chivalric code: That in the crucible of combat our differences are transformed into mutual esteem, and result in a peace which could never have been born without the fire.\n\n           \n\nThe hope of all fathers, surely, that their sons should not know war. And so, if the very concept of European nobility was martial at its core, how could it be maintained in the following ages by generations who were ignorant of war? In sterilized environs where society is removed from contest, those savage forces which necessitate empathy are at their lowest ebb. Or at least, it’s gentry are given their greatest remove from it. Empathy will always be a higher motive, but it is nearly impossible to inflict without the threat of physical engagement looming nearby. When you have had your mettle tested, when you expend yourself and are matched, there is a mutual understanding formed (a brotherhood, even) which is unlike any other. The purely pragmatic attitude of ‘knowing thy enemy,’ wary of his skill and wise to his wiles, can very naturally become respect, unalloyed. The catalyst for that transformation are the humane codes of honor to which both belligerents adhere. Thus the warrior ethos stands in the way of unbridled and irresponsible hatred; against the inhumane—the enemy made alien. The warrior ethos fosters a certain understanding, that even at odds, all are struggling at once toward humane ends. The raw, unshielded emotion drawn out by physical confrontation runs directly opposed to the duplicity and veiled intent that typifies social games, in the halls of power—where an enemy, seemingly inept, can destroy your reputation without ever having to meet your eye. It cannot be bourne. The children of an old warrior culture which has been long-removed from the real costs of conflict so often come to view the reputation as the prime concern.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nDueling\n\n \n\nAbsent the battlefield (or even the tourney ground) the means to prove oneself—in strength of conviction, in courage—withers away. And yet the cultural drive to do so remains undiminished. That drive festers. It becomes insecurity; the fragile pride of  character that confuses criticism and shame for slight and intent to wound. Such a character becomes, to borrow the term from Nietzsche, full of “consideration;” it refuses to be besmirched. In a broad stroke, the courtly manner and outward shell of chivalry shrank from charity, from duty, or even from protecting the weak. It sloughed off, in many ways and in many cases, leaving behind only self-involvement.\n\n           \n\nBy the Victorian Era, the European gentry appears shackled by a certain ignorance so easily fostered in places which come to enjoy comfort and position. There is an ease-of-living which can certainly seduce one away from the experiences of his fellows, on account of some metropolitan social distance. The foundation of understanding that arose from the common weight of conflict on the warrior nobility was, in that era, gone. They did not need to respect one another, they did not even need to know one another. Rather, they regarded one another at a curated distance, interacting instead with sterile and hypocritical silhouettes that populated the puppet shows to which the courtly manner was reduced. All that remained was the desire for an unsmudged reputation, and the uninfringed word.\n\n \n\nYoung men of that age, often harboring confused senses of duty, challenged each other over a cross remark, a refusal of hospitality, or casual disbelief.  The ensuing duel served neither the weak, nor the poor, nor the nation, nor the lord—but rather only the vanity of an individual’s reputation. Chivalric ideals are, by this time, largely excised culturally. Indeed, a system which tempers violence toward its greatest utility materially and spiritually was debased into vainglorious senseless bloodshed. A thousand years after the exploits of Charlemagne and his paladins, the remnants of their legend had been made into a burden by a society which misunderstood its lessons.\n\n \n\nBy the late 18th century most code duellos, that is, the laws under which a duel was carried out, were mostly devoted to avoiding the duel, providing opportunity for the regress of grievance and encouraging the seconds to seek every opportunity to find common ground and so avert the duel. The Royal Code of Honor by Joseph Hamilton written in 1829 elaborates on every point at which the duel might be averted and opens thus:\n\n \n\n“Honor's not captious, nor dispos'd to fight, But, seeks to shun what's wrong, and do what's right.\"\n\n \n\nI. No duel can be considered justifiable, which can be declined with honor, therefore, an appeal to arms should always be the last resource.\"\n\n \n\nIn fact, the first ten articles of the code enumerated by Hamilton outline the circumstances of offense which cannot acceptable cause a challenge, or when it would be more dishonorable to accept one. For instance:\n\n \n\n“IX. Professional gentlemen, on whose energies or talents, the lives, fortunes, or reputation of their clients may depend, can never justify their fighting duels, without making a full, and timely surrender of their trusts”\n\n \n\nFurther articles present the particular duty of the deulist’s seconds to seek between themselves every possible aversion of the duel. Of particular note:\n\n \n\n“XXIV. When bosom friends, fathers of large, or unprovided families, or very inexperienced youths are about to fight, the Seconds must be doubly justified in their solicitude for reconciliation.\n\n \n\nLVIII. When the quarrel shall have terminated, the Seconds should remind the friends and relatives of the combatants, that the slightest indiscretion in their conversation on the subject, may renew the breach, and render a second meeting fatal.”\n\n \n\nAll of these articles, so concerned with reputational insecurity in a courtly manner, describe, very broadly, a sense of cultural exhaustion. In this time, the romance and the legend has entirely receded into the background, and the only material that remains is a sheepish fixation on personal reputation: The vain shadow of chivalric glory divorced from all its ennobling quality. There is something perhaps to be said for the character tested and the conviction required, to be called to compete honorably in a duel, as a mote of the crucible that produced the chivalric ethos. However the custom of dueling as a matter of individual vainglory is discussed by scholars in exhausted terms—a culture creeping about on tiptoe, unsure of how to divest themselves of a perilous heirloom; a treasure the use of which is not so much bygone as it is unintelligible. This Anecdote is included in Hamilton’s Code Duello as well:\n\n \n\n“Major Dawson, with whose courage and good humour we are familiar, was challenged by a brother officer of equal rank, for merely pressing him to take another goblet; and General Barry was challenged by a Captain Smith, for refusing to take wine with him at dinner in a steam packet. The General in vain attempted to excuse himself, by declaring that wine invariably made him sick at sea. Dr. Dodd says, \" I have known a challenge sent to a person for going out of the room abruptly, and leaving a man of honour in the midst of a dissertation.\" We could name a thousand instances like those, which remind us of the quarrel between Viola and Sir Andrew Ague, in which the latter says, \" You broke my head for nothing;\" and Viola replies, \"You drew your sword upon me without cause.\"\n\n \n\nWhat ignorance that allowed the growth of this viler form of bloodshed transposed on the nobler, chivalric pursuit is the inevitable consequence of seeking to undertake the works of a warrior-of-old without understanding his motives. The traditions passed down to us cannot survive in part, nor can they be transplanted carelessly without careful attention paid to the motives and environs which fostered them. So it was, alienated from history in a manner most modern, that the gentlemen of Western Europe mired themselves in the aesthetic of their ancestors, parading themselves in a manner of martial costume, which their ancestors fought so desperately to avoid. Not violence, but rather, the purposelessness of it."

  "content": "Architecture and Murder\n\n \n\nNot far from Edinburgh along the river North Esk stands the famous chapel Rosslyn, and inside the chapel there is an uncommonly ornate pillar of stone. Since the 17th century, give or take, that pillar has been typically referred to as the Apprentice Pillar on account of a popular folk tale, which details its grim origins. The story goes that the chapel’s architect—a master mason—desired that one of the three columns standing behind the choir would be his masterpiece; more delicately adorned with splendid imagery than any other in the world. This was his dream. He set to work, and as he did, the master came to realize with sadness that his hands were not commensurate with that vision. Resolved still to perfect the pillar, he halted work and embarked on a trip to Rome in order to study the works of the great masters, so that he could return reinvigorated and capable of completing the pillar. During the intervening years, however, his young apprentice was blessed with a holy vision while the work sat incomplete. So divinely inspired, he succeeded with his own hands where the absent old mason had not. The apprentice carved the pillar to completion instead. It’s his work that stands in the chapel today, so-called the Apprentice Pillar.\n\n \n\nWhen the master mason returned from Rome, prepared again to attempt the completion of his opus, he was astonished to find not only that the pillar already stood there, finished, but to learn that it was his lowly apprentice who had accomplished it. To add insult to injury the mason realized, looking on his student’s work, that such a thing as this would be beyond his own skill, even now. In a fit of envy, he took up his mallet and clubbed his apprentice to death.\n\n \n\nThe master was tried for the murder of his student, and although he was condemned to death and hanged, the stonemasons guild believed even-still that it was not punishment enough. So, they carved his likeness in a small relief and placed it in the chapel across the choir where it faces the Apprentice Pillar. In this way, they cursed him to look upon his student’s work, and on his greatest failure, until the end of time.\n\n \n\nIn the medieval memory there are an enormous number of examples of apprentice masons killed by their masters—and prodigal masons killed by jealous competitors. We will examine a few in short order. Nearly identical to the story from Rosslyn, the reader will perhaps recall, is a similarly famous drama—the murder of the architect of King Solomon’s temple, Hiram Abiff of Tyre. It’s often said that Hiram was beaten to death by three jealous initiates, who demanded that he reveal to them the secrets of the trade. They buried his body in a shallow grave beneath a sprig of acacia.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately the tale of Hiram has, of course, been subject to much repetition and popular-occult attention in relatively recent years. The form in which it’s typically known today likely emerged, stylized, from modern freemasonic doctrine. It’s only on account of its popularity that mention of the story of Hiram is made now, as some readers may furrow their brow should a treatment on the present subject appear to overlook such a well-known story. However we will take care to caution the reader that freemasonry, in general, is, at best, an early-modern lens (and often a politicized, and surely a Christianized one) through which some of the materials of history have been viewed and interpreted. Modern freemasonic doctrine ought not to be confused for an authentic glimpse of the ancient mind.\n\n \n\nToward this point we’ll note that sources from earlier than the 18th century on the character Hiram Abiff omit his murder entirely. We are told by the Roman chronicler Josephus only that an architect, or artificer, from Tyre called Hiram was tasked with the building of the temple by King Solomon. It was Hiram, according to Josephus, who was responsible for the temple’s wondrous stature and as well for the twin pillars Boaz and Joachim. There is, again however, no word in Josephus’s writings concerning the death of that architect whatsoever. Similarly, an Aramaic commentary on the Biblical book of Esther credits Hiram for the building of a throne for King Solomon; though once again, sparing no words on his supposed murder. The bulk of the freemasonic fancy which surrounds the tale of Hiram’s death, only begins to appear with any commonality in sources so late as the 19th century. Recent scholarship has suggested, quite conclusively, that the freemasonic story of Hiram’s murder can have its origins no earlier than the mid-18th century.\n\n \n\nWith all that said, we can sidestep Hiram and the modern freemasons, and train our attention more neatly on deciphering the many ancient traditions on which modern tales—like that of Hiram—were modeled. The specific source from which 19th century dramatists drew the story of Hiram’s death was proposed by the historian Paul Naudon: A medieval epic titled Les Quatre Fils Aymon, the oldest iteration of which dates to the 12th century. This particular cycle involves the death of a knight; one Renaud de Montauban. Following his return from the Crusades, Renaud travels to Cologne and enters the monastery of St. Pantaleon, where he apprentices himself to the masons who are constructing a cathedral dedicated to St. Peter. In one account he is killed by his fellow masons because of his strenuous diligence, which shames them. In another, he is killed out of jealousy—on account of his work is superior to theirs. In both, Renaud is possessed of some secret knowledge or divine capacity and is beaten to death by envious stonemasons, armed with their hammers. His body is cast into the river and thus concealed.\n\n \n\nEven still Renaud’s murder is easily identified with the killing of an earlier, 10th century Benedictine monk—St. Reinold (or Reinhold von Koln)—who as well, angered master masons by often surpassing their work. He was eventually beaten to death by such a group of rival architects, and his body was cast into the Rhine. So it is that Reinold remains the patron saint of Stonemasons. In his death we can sense, too, some poetic similarity with the martyrdom of St. Boniface.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Builders' Rites\n\n \n\nInvestigating the great tangle of symbolism that links death to architectural consecration, one will begin to recognize that these much younger medieval tales—of an architect’s death or murder—are all apparently recollections of a much older practice, in which, a human sacrifice was believed to serve some architectural function. Whatever that function was, it was not isolated to the foundations of a temple or church, but occurred at one time or another with most major architectural undertakings. Foundation rituals, or as they've been called in some places, the builders' rites, have been performed at the construction of family homes, as well as beneath the city gates, at bridges, or below the city walls.\n\n \n\nIt has been suggested in the past even that the founding of Rome; the story of conflict between Romulus and Remus, can be correctly understood as a version of just such a foundation sacrifice. The memory of the death of Remus at the construction site of the city wall is, for example, qualitatively similar to the story of the reconstruction of Jericho, by Ahab. When the voice of the god of the Hebrews pulled down the walls of Jericho, Joshua issued a curse on whoever would seek to rebuild the city in the future, requiring that they would have to sacrifice their eldest and youngest sons to keep the walls from falling over. So Ahab, who rebuilt Jericho, is said to have sacrificed his eldest, Abiram, beneath the walls and his youngest, Segub, beneath the gates. There is a germ here linking the lack of sacrifice to instability, which is by no means original to, nor isolated to the Hebraic canon.\n\n \n\nOne story persists from the 6th century in which St. Columba entombed a young man named Odran in the cathedral at Iona, in order to stop it from falling apart during construction. Another story of late-medieval Romanian provenance concerns the architect Manole, who also faced the periodical collapse of work at the Curtea de Arges monastery in Wallachia. Both for Manole and St. Columba, whatever progress was made during the day on the church collapsed at night. The structure only stood firm after he resolved to immure his own wife in the foundations—as the literary episode recounts—according to the directions of God in a dream. Both stories are strikingly similar to that of Vortigern and Merlin in the Historia Brittonum. Both are connected by numerous scholars to dozens of other tales—the Hungarian tragedy of Kelemen the Stonemason, the Magyar song of Clement the Mason, there is even a Greek incarnation attributed to the building of the Bridge at Arta. A Bulgarian version retains the same name for the titular architect, Manol. Often glossed in sparse works that endeavor only to catalog the many related myths of this sort, is the Georgian story of a boy called Zurab who was sacrificed to ensure the stability of the fortress at Surami. Even today there remains a strange, perpetually dampened area along the bottom of the battlements, on account of some unidentified internal water source in the rock. According to local tradition Zurab’s mother wept there at the spot where he was immured and her tears never dried, and so on, and so on.\n\n \n\nThe idea that a human sacrifice serves some architectural function during the construction process is not peculiar to European and Near Eastern cultures, either. In Japan there persisted up to modern times an identical tradition, called Hitobashira (人柱), literally meaning the ‘human pillar.’ It’s a practice that has analogues in China, Burma, and Indonesia, and involved the ritual killing and burial of a person beneath, or near to important architectural structures. This was done, according to tradition, in order to secure their stability. Da Sheng Zhuang, as the old practice was called in China, is said to have been first proposed by a master architect of the Zhou Dynasty, called Lu Ban. Although later deified, Lu Ban’s birth is recorded at the end of the 6th century B.C., in the year 507. There is a perhaps a clue in the fact that the Chinese attribute the invention of the practice of architectural sacrifice to Lu Ban—to whom they also attribute the invention of the architect’s square, the saw, the drill, the planar, the shovel, and many other fundamental tools of the trade. We can glimpse the degree to which the foundation sacrifice was, as well, considered among the absolutely elementary tools of the architect by the Chinese. Many bridges, dams, palaces, and city walls across the East are remembered in the local legends as having been constructed atop sacrificial victims; men, women, and even children, just the same as in Europe.\n\n \n\nRather than continue to survey the literature item-by-item (after all, we mean to understand the ritual—not to catalog instances of its performance), we’ll instead content ourselves only to note here that the commonality and persistence of this folk system suggests that we are dealing with an idea so elemental in the mind of man, that cultures isolated from one another in time and space arrived, in their own manner of course, nevertheless at similar conclusions. While there is an Indo-European branch on this tree, it cannot be denied that the roots of that tree reach down into the most general, far-ancient, and humane soil. Gould writes of the same mind, in his own survey of the lore, that “one swallow does not make a summer, it is true, but a straw will tell the direction of the wind.”\n\n \n\nBefore we attempt to lay hold of the rationale underlying the architectural sacrifice, it will be worthwhile first to spare some words on the procession of many later traditions—which we will argue are only deteriorations of that elder rationale—in order to separate those things from the core of the issue.\n\n \n\nSpeth explains rather optimistically that “every race in turn, in its progress towards a higher and purer culture, at some period or other, rejects human sacrifice, and replaces it with animal sacrifice in the first instance, then with vegetable, and finally with a more symbolical sacrifice.” Naturally, the idea that this procession from ritual to imitation represents a maturation, or indeed a “purification” of the culture is no-doubt a sign of the times in which Speth advanced his survey of the rites. Even still, the simple observation that the sacrifice was substituted for other things over time is accurate, no matter the editorial opinion with respect to whether or not such a procession represents a heightening, or indeed, a muddling of the tradition.\n\n \n\nSo we see in pouring over the histories that a human victim may at times be exchanged for an animal, an animal may be exchanged even for a meal prepared from its slaughter, or even in some Hindu traditions, a sacrificial cow substituted merely for an offering of butter. A sprinkling of blood on a foundation stone (as in the Pictish tales), whether from a live human victim—who may only provide the blood, not necessarily the life itself—or from an animal; both occasion to suffice. In other places, paper effigies of sacrificial victims are merely burnt in offering. Votive figures are often deposited beneath the foundation stone, or in the foundation trenches, or beneath critical structural members. In some cases wine is offered in exchange for blood. It’s been noted by popular consensus that the tradition of breaking a bottle of wine to christen a ship is, in fact, done in place of the neck of a victim—and is an echo of the foundation sacrifice; for as Speth, Eliade, and many others have noted in their own way: While the rationale for a custom is inevitably forgotten, the custom itself tends to persist, and be justified according to different fashions.\n\n \n\nOne additional curiosity in the realm of sacrificial substitution, or sacrificial simulation—perhaps being a better term—is the tradition of capturing a living shadow within the construction, rather than victim himself. Frazer treats the subject quite thoroughly, so we’ll refrain from justifying the connection between soul and shadow, according to the ancients. The idea of capturing a man’s shadow is deeply connected to the esoteric importance of measurement, about which I have written extensively elsewhere. Speth notes of this curious practice, in-passing, that “not long ago in England there were still shadow-traders whose business [was] to provide the architects with the necessary measure of shadows.” The capture of the shadow often took the form of measuring it in one way or another, and that article of measurement is what was offered as representative of the shadow, which was itself representative of the human victim. In many cases it was thought that the individual whose shadow was captured (that is, whose soul was separated) would die in short order.\n\n \n\nWe recall, in considering the connection of a lost shadow to human sacrifice, the various Greek analogues that survive in the mythical record at Mt. Lykaion, for example, in the central Peloponnesus. Pausanias tells us that the sacred precinct at the summit of Lykaion, just beneath the Ash Altar to Zeus, was a place no person was permitted to enter. Trespassing in the temenos would result in death. Pausanias also tells us that huntsmen whose game crossed the boundary of the temenos saw that animals lost their shadows while within. As for the particular rites and rituals conducted at that site, in his time, Pausanias says only that he was hesitant to inquire after the specifics on account of their sheer antiquity. Human sacrifice is attested in the literary record by numerous authors at Lykaion, and elsewhere in the Greek textual record as well. Along the same train of thought, we might observe that the legacy of anthropomorphic architectural ornamentation—so common in the Hellenic tradition, although by no means contained to it—that is, of shaping pillars after male or female figures (Telamons, Caryatids) was perhaps meant to recall in some way the foundation sacrifice. It is not difficult at all to imagine such ornamentation even as votives, after a fashion: The forlorn figure of a man or woman quite literally supporting the temple’s edifice; bearing its weight. Alas in the field of Greek archaeology human sacrifice is an idea which, even still today, remains of the utmost academic contention—but nevermind.\n\n \n\nIn his consuming studies of the folk traditions, Grimm wrote of foundation sacrifices, that “…it was often thought necessary to immure live animals and even men in the foundation on which the structure was to be raised, as if they were a sacrifice offered to the earth, who had to bear the load upon her: By this inhuman rite they hoped to secure immovable stability or other advantages.” Apocryphal or not, what we find in these stories of murder associated with a sacred precinct is a common theme in many cultures—even though at times dissolute and nearly unrecognizable; it is an echo of a chorus most ancient, and most familiar to man. It assures us of a complex and fundamental relationship between death and the setting-out of a sacred structure.\n\n \n\nThere are two lines of thinking which are typically presented by those who have wondered after the origins of the foundation sacrifice. And although both typically earn a nod of the head at first glance, upon more thorough consideration, neither argument seems to actually constitute a substantial answer. The first is one that we have not yet brushed up against in the present discussion, and that is the idea that the structure needed to be supplied with a soul, in the form of a human sacrifice, in order to fill some apotropaic or protective function. The second is the idea that a human sacrifice was required, according to some logic, in order to ensure the stability of the construction.\n\n \n\nConsidering first; the theory of ensoulment and apotropaic magic, it seems to follow, then, that the character of the person who is to be sacrificed would matter. That is, the person whose soul would be charged with, or transformed by a duty so noble as the protection of the temple from ruin, or the gates from invaders, would surely be limited to those of, at the very least, virtuous character or noteworthy stature—that they be well suited to such a duty. And yet, what we see by scrutinizing both the textual and the archaeological record is that often times those offered in sacrifice were criminals, slaves, or even infant children. Why would one sacrifice a thief, and forever charge his soul with the safekeeping of a sacred precinct? Was the wife of Manole, weeping and begging him to stop while he and his laborers somberly laid up the wall around her, truly a desirable candidate to hold the stones of the great cathedral firm? The spirit of this explanation appears clearly at odds with the spirit of the myths, and the material record. Often times victims who were not sacrificed to the builder's rites for punitive reasons, instead had to be trapped, tricked, or otherwise ensorcelled into the position and remained unwilling participants once they realized their fate.\n\n \n\nThe cadence of the myths seems more to suggest not that a specific person was required to inhabit the structure, or that a person was required to furnish their soul according to the performance of some noble task—but rather, such a wide variety of sacrifices suggests only that any person at all would do for whatever purpose the ritual was thought to fulfill. What was critical was the death itself, according to some rationale, and the poetic tragedy of who it was that fate consigned to the stones then, perhaps, might come to serve a literary purpose thereafter. So we gather that the operative component of the ritual plainly concerned the death, and not so much the person being put to death. Much more likely it seems, that stories of apotropaic ensoulment are comparatively remote from the true purpose of the practice. As men forgot the specific reason for why it was necessary to make the sacrifice, they recalled only that sacrifices were made; only that in these old places bloody rituals were once performed. It’s not so far a leap at all to make, the thought that the discontented spirits of those who were offered for some mysterious purpose by master artisans of lost ages, still wander those structures, safekeeping them from intruders—or, as the case may be, haunting their long and time-eaten corridors. One finds it easy to imagine that men of later times would come to believe that this was, in fact, the function of the sacrifice.\n\n \n\nWith respect to the second theory—that a human sacrifice won stability on the part of the edifice, the general idea appears to be that because some disturbance was made on the earth in order to construct the wall, or the house, or the temple, that this in-turn required a placation of the earth, or, of some earth spirit or analogue. It’s this idea that Grimm recounts and offers as explanatory. This as well, however, begs a rather puzzling question. What is it about the sacrifice of a living human that would work to placate such a spirit? Often, as time advances and the memory fades, the idea of a specific deity being placated isn’t even mentioned. Many writers are content to simply repeat the idea for fact that a sacrifice must be made in order to ensure the stability of the edifice. But the same question appears. One still wonders why a human sacrifice was taken to confer stability to a structure at all—what is it that links the one to the other? Our object here is to clarify (at last) the nature of that relationship.\n\n \n\nAgain and again the earnest student of ancient teachings is faced with very much in the way of lists and tables of data, and very little in the way of a holistic understanding for why that data was produced. The modern mind is so often alienated from man of antiquity. The easier path is to presume his superstitious ignorance wherever we ourselves fail to grasp the finer points of his qualitative train of thought. Of all the celebrated authors who are guilty of this prejudice, none are more guilty than Frazer—but that is beside the point. As it stands, the very fact that these two explanatory lines have been supplied so often, and for so long, suggests that we ought not to dispense with them as crucial pieces of the puzzle. However, we cannot mistake these pieces for the full picture either, as even taking one or both on board as accurate still fails to supply us with a clear answer as to the question of why.\n\n \n\nIn order to get to the root of the issue, we will first have to spare some words on the subject of the role of death or killing in cosmogonic myths. Equipped in that way, we can then venture to alloy the question of why with a brief foray into the subject of theurgical magic—and therein lies the satisfactory picture. It can hardly be denied that the architectural task in antiquity was intimately connected to cosmological theory by magical ritual. As we will come to understand, the linkage between sacrifice and stability emerges quite naturally from a theurgical manner of thinking about architecture and cosmogony.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nCosmogonic Killing\n\n \n\nIn a great many traditions the cosmogonic act—that is, the genesis of the cosmos—is instigated by the death, the sacrifice, or the killing of a primordial being. The reader will hopefully oblige treatment of a representative portion of those traditions, in order to produce some clarity on the subject, now. Among the Chinese the ancient belief was that in Illo tempore, to borrow the term from Eliade, the giant Pangu emerged from a cosmic egg—a common cosmogonic symbol that, while most commonly associated with Orphism, is by no means exclusive to the Greek anima. With his axe Pangu split the yin from the yang, and held them apart. When Pangu died, the various parts of his body became the various parts of the world. In the Chaldean religion, the great cosmic monster Tiamat was fought and defeated by Marduk, who dismembers her and sets out the elements and the architecture of the cosmos from her body. The Vedic character Purusa—which became a more complex concept over the long march of time, was in its earliest form a primordial being whose body in death enabled the creation of the cosmos just the same.\n\n \n\nThe story of the dismemberment and resurrection of Osiris among the Egyptians is an obvious analogue. Among the Greeks the mysterious and controversial figure of Zagreus is of interest. The etymology of the name is a subject of some dispute, It has been suggested as relating in different ways by different scholars to ideas like youth, life or life-giving, or to identify Zagreus as a skilled hunter. Whatever the case may be, Zagreus was a chthonic deity. In the Alcmeonis, and as well for Aeschylus, Zagreus was a chief god of the underworld. Numerous sources, Euripides foremost among them, relay that Zagreus enjoyed ritual significance in particular among the Cretans, for whom he was a counterpart to Dionysos; a patron of strange and ancient nocturnal rites that involved the consumption of raw flesh. In the Orphic tradition, the story of Zagreus is revealed in a form that would persist into the era of the Neoplatonists, and even enjoy some degree of Christian inculturation. The Orphic myths establish Zagreus not just as a counterpart to Dionysos, but as his prior form.\n\n \n\nAccording to the Orphic sources, Zagreus was the offspring of Zeus and Persephone. As an infant Zagreus was watched over by the Kouretes, Curetes, or, those same Idaean Dakytloi who watched over the infant Zeus. Nevertheless Zagreus was attacked and captured by the Titans, who dismembered him in an episode known as the Sparagmos, boiled him in a cauldron, and consumed his body. Enraged on account of their transgression, Zeus struck the titans down with his lightning bolt and it was from their ashes that mankind was created. In the versions of this story which were assembled by Euphorion and by Callimachus, Rhea (much like Isis in the Osirian myth) collected the pieces of Zagreus and reassembled him, resulting in his resurrection and rebirth in the form of Dionysos. This Orphic account of the creation of man, or the Anthropogony as it’s been termed, has enjoyed multiple treatments across the centuries. In any case, echoes of the distant idea—that creation is brought about by the body part of the divine—survive as fragments in later canona. Take for example that of the goddess Aphrodite being born of the castration of Uranus. For the Persians in their turn, the body of Kuni becomes the world, his bones the mountains, his hair the plants and growing things, his flesh the earth, etc. In the Rig Veda the primeval figure Purushta is dismembered and reconfigured into the world. The list of cosmogonic sacrifices is long. The following two verses serve well to generalize these ideas. First, an Oracle delivered to the King of Cyprus, and second, from Basavanna (820):\n\n​\n\n+\n\n \n\nA god I am such as I show to thee\n\nThe Starry Heavens are my head, my trunk the sea,\n\nEarth forms my feet, mine ears the air supplies\n\nThe Sun’s far-darting, brilliant rays, mine eyes\n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe rich\n\nWill make temples for Shiva,\n\nWhat shall I,\n\nA poor man do?\n\nMy legs are pillars,\n\nThe body the shrine,\n\nThe head a cupola of gold.\n\nListen, O Lord of the meeting rivers,\n\nThings standing shall fall,\n\nBut the moving ever shall stay.\n\n \n\nWe find a similar figure in the Eddas among the Germanics: the giant Ymir. Created of the elements within the primordial, grassless plain called Ginnungagap, Ymir suckled from the celestial cow and was killed by the grandsons of Buri—Odin, Vili, and Ve. From his blood they fashioned the rivers and the oceans, from his flesh the earth, from the dome of his skull the dome of the sky, and so on. It’s well known that Ymir is identified with an earlier deity who appears in the writing of Tacitus on the Germanic tribes of his era: Tuisto. Even the name Tuisto has been connected specifically to Ymir by philological effort. Tacitus writes, “In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past, they celebrate an earth-born god, Tuisto, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders.”\n\n \n\nCuriously, the conjunction of the giant and the cow establish Ymir’s legend as part of an even older and deeper Proto-Indo-European mytheme. In the Old Irish tales, for example, the pieces of the body of Finnbhenach the bull are dropped around Ireland, becoming features of the land and inspiring place names. Adams and Mallory have conducted an in-depth survey of cosmogonic themes among the Indo-European peoples, and reconstructed their essential Proto-Indo-European elements. To quote them, for it hardly serves to try and form the thought more neatly than they have themselves: “The [Proto-Indo-European] cosmogonic myth is centered on the dismemberment of a divine being—either anthropomorphic, or bovine—and the creation of the universe out of its various elements.” Of the most pure notion of sacrifice as the Indo-European mind seems to have carried it forward, out of the far-reaching mists of the early histories, Adams and Mallory write that\n\n \n\n“the relationship between sacrifice and cosmogony was not solely that of a primordial event, but the entire act of sacrifice among the Indo-Europeans might be seen as a re-creation of the universe where elements were being continuously recycled. Sacrifice thus represents a creative reenactment of the initial cosmic dismemberment, and it helps return the material stuff to the world.”\n\n \n\nHere we may have the truth of the matter. Dismemberment coincides with consumption, which, engenders sustenance. It can hardly have escaped man even in the earliest days that death and dismemberment was required by, and preceded the allaying of the forces of voracity which withered him, and that in taking into himself some sacrificial material—as the Titans sacrificed, dismembered, and consumed Zagreus; as the sons of Buri dismembered Ymir—his own constitution was protracted. It follows on that the cycle of sacrifice is connected to man’s persistence in time, and follows on as well in sympathetic terms that sacrifice in some divine manner is connected to the persistence of time itself. So Kronos consumed his children.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nArchitectural Theurgy\n\n \n\nThe world, perpetual though changing, originated in many traditions, as we've seen, with a death. There is of course a certain sympathy at play in that idea—identified with the old and common notion that mortal life in this plane begins with the fall or death of the immortal soul, and its subsequent mundane incarnation. Identifying the temple, the city, the home (or any structure which was considered symbolic of the cosmological center; of the king, of the people, of the family) with both the cosmos and with himself, man across time ordained according to sympathetic rationale that such structures must be founded on a death as well. That is why sacrifice is the oldest operating principle of the builders’ rites; later only, blood, later only an animal, later only a votive. The moment of death occurring within the precinct, or otherwise figuring into the literal foundations of the temple is critical in the ritual's purest form.\n\n \n\nEliade describes, in his treatise on the legend of Master Manole (which has regrettably never appeared in an English translation), that in many traditions of magical construction the ground, the earth, or the site was first consecrated. The meaning of this consecration is the ritualistic transformation of the site into the center of the world. That is, the transformation of the mundane land into the mythical land upon which the cosmic creation occurred. Next, the sacrifice would be carried out according to what can best be described as theurgical intentions.\n\n \n\nTheurgy, for the purposes of the discussion at hand, provides the most fertile analogical framework for explaining the construction ritual because, as a form of magical practice, it is entirely unalloyed with other disciplines—as, for example, palmistry requires the companion study of the symbolism in the hand, geomancy of the symbolism in precious stones, astrology of the symbolism contained in the figures and lore of the stars. Theurgy, even in its more decadent, Byzantine forms, only employed curios of the other magical disciplines as inert qualitative linkages to set the stage, as it were, for the ritual. What is theurgy?\n\n \n\nAs ever we begin by scrutinizing the name, as the name of a thing is inseparable from its spirit. While the first half of the word is self explanatory, the second descends from a Proto-Indo-European root that translates most nearly to the act of making. In this sense, Theurgy is a deeply ancient notion that springs from the Pontic-Caspian recesses of the Indo-European mind. It is the act of ‘making god,’ or more specifically, of engendering possession; of a ritualist by the deity evoked in the ritual, of an idol by the deity with which it’s associated, and so on. Plotinus explains,\n\n \n\n\"I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.\"\n\n \n\nIn the simplest way theurgy is the process of identifying a mundane thing with a divine thing, and in-so doing, the one becomes the other. Inviting possession by a divine being is a younger idea developed from this elder sensibility. Eliade correctly noted theurgical identification in discussing the Sabazia, writing\n\n \n\n“The ceremonies took place at night, in the mountains, by torchlight; a wild music (the sounds of bronze cauldrons, cymbals, and flutes) inspired believers to joyous outcries and to dances in furious circles. [quoting Euripides] ‘It was especially women who indulged in these disorderly and exhausting dances; their costume was strange; they wore bessares, long, floating garments made, it seems, from foxskins; above those, deerskins, and probably horns on their heads.’ In their hands they held snakes consecrated to Sabazius, daggers, or thyrsi. Attaining paroxysm, ‘sacred madness,’ they siezed animals chosen to be sacrificed and tore them to pieces, eating the raw flesh. This ritual omophagy produced identification with the god; the participants now called themselves Sabos or Sabazius. … Ecstatic experiences strengthened the conviction that the soul is not only autonomous but that it is capable of an unio mystica with the divinity.”\n\n \n\nIdentification is the magical modus operandi par excellance. Understanding this, the purpose of the foundation sacrifice is revealed to be the magical identification of the mundane site into the sacred, mythical ground of the original creation; transforming the one into the other. In conducting that transformation, the temple is to be imbued with, and ensured of the same stability and enduring permanence that suffuses the cosmos.\n\n \n\nWielding the death as a kind-of building material in this way, if you will, is likely the reason too for why many victims, in countless traditions, were interred alive. Again, the death itself is important. The idea that the structure needed to be ensouled, and that the soul acted to protect, keep, or safeguard the architecture is an outgrowth of a much more central rationale: The temple falls apart as the body falls apart, as all things do. It is the soul which enables the bodily clay to, for a time, resist the decaying forces which typify the material world. At the precise moment of death, that is, with the passing on of whatever-it-is that animates the inanimate body, that endows it with humanity and with personage, in a word, the soul, the body quickly withers away into the earth. And so it follows that—as the cosmos, body, and temple are models of one another, and as the cosmos originated in the sacrifice of a mythical or godly stature, the architectural object would suffer the some sort of analogous obliteration without the offering of a soul to contravene that tendency. The cosmogonic killing, or sacrifice at the moment of all creation, is in-turn what supplied the world with its own contravening principle.\n\n \n\nAs a final thought offered in addendum to the foregoing observations, we might observe at the close that there is, as well, a much more material frame of mind, which stands harmoniously with these magical deliberations. Consider that when the temple collapses during construction or soon thereafter, as very often it did in antiquity, it would have been a matter of no complicated conjecture that some improper preparation at the level of the foundations was commonly the culprit. For architects of any age, creating a level and stable interface between the structure and the site is of critical importance. Even in the architecture schools today it’s often said that to raise a building, first you dig a hole. Euthentyria was the name given by the Greeks to the leveling course, beneath the stereobates, which was set out first upon the prepared ground. Ergo, the symptom of collapse was easily identified with the apparent stability of the soil. It's not that human sacrifice directly provided stability, but rather, that without the human sacrifice the structure was doomed—and only that the way in which it was doomed tended to be metered out from the earth beneath. In this way the literal manner of failure enjoyed a symbolic confluence with the theurgic idea of the temple: Without providing a body, as a body was provided in the cosmogony, the earth itself—the bodily clay—would fail to support the temple. There could be no creation without destruction. Elsewhere, I have termed the artisanal instantiation of the doctrine of costs as the creative antagonism, and likened it to the canonical deformities that tend to be exhibited by the artisanal gods. It’s worth mentioning again. Thus, much scholarship on the question that ventures to repeat this common line mistakes a symptom for a cause."

  "content": "He first framed,\nFor the children of earth,\nThe heaven as a roof—\nHoly Creator!'— CÆDMON.\n\n \n\n'Look you, this brave, o’erhanging firmament,\nThis majestical roof fretted with golden fire'— HAMLET.\n\n \n\nWe speak of the sky as a vault, a dome; but before domes or vaults were invented it evidently could have been likened to neither. It was then without doubt a ceiling, a flat extension. Of course the sky was understood to be hollow, semi-spherical, at a very early time indeed; but it is evidently a more advanced and philosophical view than the other.\n\n​\n\nIf we may take it as proved that the architectural dome was known and first reared in Chaldea (see Perrot) by a people who saw in the sky a solid hemisphere, and much given to nature symbolism in their buildings; may not the design and daring construction of the cupola be attributed to the form of the heavenly dome, and the desire that the 'ceiling' of the temple should still recall the ceiling of the great nature temple?\n\n​\n\nThere is such a clear and constraining congruity between them that to describe a dome seems to call for the simile to the firmament: St Paul's, for instance—\n\n​\n\n'Whose sky-like dome\nHath typified, by reach of daring art,\nInfinity's embrace' — Wordsworth\n\n​\n\nIt may be said that at great periods of architecture ceilings were always skies. Viollet-le-Duc tells us, in his Dictionnaire de l’Architecture (Art. Peinture), that the whole scheme of interior colour had to be readjusted in the thirteenth century to harmonise with the vaults, which were painted the most brilliant of blues, parsemee, with gold stars, against which nothing could hold its own but vermilion, black, and more gold. The Sainte Chapelle of Paris may be taken for example; and in England, 'Conrad's glorious choir,' built in 1150. In Italy, at the same time, the practice was universal. It will suffice to refer to Siena and Orvieto Cathedrals with their vaults, stars on azure; in Orvieto, still untouched, in wonderful harmony of changing and decaying colour, blue to emerald, like the evening sky while as yet the earliest star alone burns there.\n\n​\n\nIn Giotto's Arena Chapel at Padua, the walls are covered with pictured panels, the background of all alike being of blue leading up to the sky of the vault. Again in Italy—but this time in pure Byzantine style direct from Constantinople—the dome of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, at Ravenna, is a magnificent instance in brilliant mosaic; blue, powdered with a profusion of stars to the zenith. In Sta. Sophia itself, the ciborium over the altar was supported on four silver pillars, the under side of the dome twinkling with stars. The manual obtained by Didron on Mount Athos describes how ceilings should be designed as heavens.\n\n​\n\nIn 'Roman' Rome, the gorgeous taste of Nero seems to have affected these ceilings at the Golden Palace; and Tacitus gives an account of the scene at Pompey's theatre on the occasion of the reception of an Eastern prince:—'The stage and the whole inside of that noble structure were cased with gold: such a profusion of wealth and magnificence had never been displayed to view. To screen the spectators from the rays of the sun, a purple canopy, inlaid with golden stars, was spread over their heads.' A Roman example may be seen in Smith's 'Dictionary' (Art. Penates).\n\n​\n\nAs showing that it touched the imagination and was no mere decorative tradition, better than facts, we have fiction and legends, the twelfth century guidebook to the eternal city, the Mirabilia Vrbis Romæ (Nichols) contains the account of 'a temple that was called Holovitreum, being made of glass and gold by mathematical craft, where was an astronomy with all the signs of the heavens, the which was destroyed by St Sebastian.' A MS. of the fourteenth century, incorporated in the same book, tells of the wonders of the Flavian amphitheatre. 'The Colosseum was the temple of the sun, of marvellous greatness and beauty, disposed with many diverse vaulted chambers, and all covered with a heaven of gilded brass, where thunders and lightnings and glittering fires were made, and where rain was shed through slender tubes. Besides this, there were the signs super-celestial and the planets Sol and Luna, that were drawn along in their proper chariots. And in the midst abode Phœbus—that is, the god of the sun—which, having his feet on the earth, reached into heaven with his head, and did hold in his hand an orb, signifying that Rome ruled over the world.' Our own Higden, in the Polychronicon, adds to the might and marvel of the sun-god in this place:—'This brazen statue, gilded with imperial gold, continually shed rays through the darkness, and turned round in even movement with the sun, carrying his face always opposite to the solar body; and all the Romans when they came near worshipped, in token of subjection.' The story of a temple of glass is especially interesting. Benjamin of Tudela about the same time describes another as existing at Damascus.\n\n​\n\nIn the Dietrich Romances, King Laurin of the Rose Garden has a subterranean palace to which he carries off his bride. In it 'the walls were of polished marble inlaid with gold and silver; the floor was formed of a single agate, the ceiling of a sapphire, and from it there hung shining carbuncles like stars in the blue sky of night.'\n\n​\n\nIn the 'Parsifal,' Titurel, the ancestor of the hero, builds on Mount Salvatch a temple worthy to enshrine the sangreal. It was discovered that the rock or core of the mountain was one entire onyx of enormous size, and this was flattened into a flooring and polished with great care. One morning the plan was found miraculously marked out and all the materials ready, and with supernatural aid the temple was soon completed. It was circular in form, and had seventy-two octagonal choirs and thirty-six belfries. In the midst was a tower with many windows, its topmost point a ruby, out of which rose a cross of clear crystal surmounted by a golden eagle with outstretched wings. 'Within the building, sculptured vines, roses, and lilies twined about the pillars, forming bowers, on whose branches birds seem to flutter as if alive. At every intersection of the arches was a glowing carbuncle that turned night into day; and the vaulted roof was blue, of sapphire, in which a miracle of art was to be seen. The sun, moon, and stars, placed there by the builders, moved in, the same order as the real luminaries in the heavens. In the wide inner space of the great temple a second and smaller sanctuary was built, resembling the first, but far more beautiful. This was the place intended for the sangreal should it come down to earth' (Wagner and M‘Dowall).\n\n​\n\nThe alliterative Romance of Alexander (Early English Text) describes the palace of Candace as built all of gold, encrusted with precious stones, on pillars of polished porphyry. An inner chamber was by sorcery wonderfully founded, and 'made by marvel to move.' 'Twenty tamed oliphants turned it about,' and, as the Queen and Alexander entered, it began to revolve.\n\n​\n\nSimilar imagery is used in the popular mediæval history, 'The Invention of the Cross' in Caxton's 'Golden Legend,' and other earlier Cross poems. One of the thirteenth century, published by the Early English Text Society, says: There was a king named 'Cosdre' (Chosroes). He conquered many lands. He came to Jerusalem and took possession of a part of the sweet Cross, which he removed to Persia.\n\n​\n\n'A swithe heig towr of gold and seluer he let him sone a-rere\nOf gimmes and of stones precious ther aboute he lette do;\nTourne of sonne and mon and of sterres also\nSchinen, as hit themself were and tornen a-boute faste\nAnd thunderinge he made eke that the folk ofte agaste\n’Mid small holes throwh queyntyse that water ofte ther\nHe made hit ofte to grounde falle as they hit reyn were\nAs ferforth as couthe eny mon make mid queyntyse\nThe fourme as it an hevene were he made on alle wise.'\n\n​\n\nHere he rears a throne, and set himself up as a god. Heraclius, the emperor, makes war on Chosroes, and finds him on the throne in his false heaven where he slays him, and then restores the sacred wood to Jerusalem.\n\n​\n\nSir H. Rawlinson, writing of Ecbatana in the 'Journal of the Geographical Society,' quotes Cedrenus, the Byzantine historian, on the wars of Justinian and Heraclius against Chosroes. Heraclius, when he took possession of Canzaca, 'found the abominable image of Chosroes; a figure of the king enthroned beneath the globular dome of the palace, as though he were seated in the heavens; around him were emblems of the sun and moon and stars, to which, in his superstition, he seemed to offer adoration, as if to the gods, while sceptre-bearing angels ministered on every side, and curiously-wrought machines distilled drops of water, to represent the falling rain, and uttered roaring sounds in imitation of the peals of thunder. All these things the emperor consumed with fire, and, at the same time, he reduced to ashes the temple and the entire city.'\n\n​\n\nCanzaca was taken by Heraclius in 628. Rawlinson (VII. Monarchy) tells us of the even greater splendours of Dastagherd:—'The Orientals say that the palace was supported on forty thousand columns of silver, adorned by thirty thousand rich hangings upon the walls, and further ornamented by a thousand globes suspended from the roof' (p. 528). 'The royal crown—which could not be worn, but was hung from the ceiling by a gold chain exactly over the head of the king when he took his seat in his throne-room—is said to have been adorned with a thousand pearls, each as large as an egg. The throne itself was of gold, and was supported on four feet, each formed of a single enormous ruby' (p. 640). The globes were 'probably of crystal or gold.' A curtain shut off the king from ordinary gaze, and the courtiers were organised in seven ranks. In the paradise attached were beasts for the chase—lions and tigers, gazelles, peacocks and pheasants. But the most splendid of these palaces was that of Ctesiphon, taken by the Arabs not ten years later than the campaign of Heraclius, the facade of which stands to-day with its great arched portal, seventy-two feet wide and eighty-five feet high. 'In the centre was the Hall of Audience—a noble apartment one hundred and fifteen feet long and eighty-five feet high, with a magnificent vaulted roof, bedecked with golden stars so arranged as to represent the motions of the planets among the twelve signs of the zodiac—where the monarch was accustomed to sit on a golden throne.' The treasury was full of gold, gems, and arms; spices, gums, and perfumes. 'In one apartment was found a carpet of white brocade four hundred and fifty feet long and ninety broad, with a border worked in precious stones of various hues, to represent a garden of all kinds of beautiful flowers. The leaves were formed of emeralds, the blossoms and buds of pearls, rubies, and sapphires, and other gems of immense value.' There was a horse of gold with a jewelled saddle, and a camel of silver; suits of gold armour, scimitars, and 'cuirasses of Solomon' (Rawlinson (VII. Mon. 565).\n\n​\n\nThere can be no doubt that these many notices show us the ceremony of the Persian court continued through centuries. The king was a god, 'brother of the sun and moon,' as he calls himself; and he sat in the middle of a universe of his own, ministered to by the seven orders of the heavenly hierarchy—as in China, there are nine who surround the throne.\n\n​\n\nIt accords well with the theatrical genius of Nero that he should have copied this solemn and magical symbolism (which; we have also seen, formed part of the Mithraic ritual) in a mere supper-room of his palace.\n\n​\n\nOf this wonderful palace, called the Golden House, sober annalists give accounts marvellous in comparison even with the marvels of romance. 'In nothing,' says Suetonius, was he more prodigal than in his buildings. He completed his palace by continuing it from the Palatine to the Esquiline Hill, calling the building at first only \"The Passage;\" but after it was burnt down and rebuilt, the \"Golden House.\" Of its dimensions and furniture it may be sufficient to say thus much: the porch was so high that there stood in it a colossal statue of himself a hundred and twenty feet in height, and the space included in it was so ample that it had triple porticos a mile in length; and a lake like a sea, surrounded with buildings that had the appearance of a city; within its area were cornfields, vineyards, pastures, and woods containing a vast number of animals of various kinds, both wild and tame. In other parts it was entirely overlaid with gold, and adorned with gold and mother-of-pearl. The supper-rooms were vaulted, and compartments of the ceilings, inlaid with ivory, were made to revolve, and scatter flowers; while they contained pipes which shed unguents upon the guests. The chief banqueting-room was circular, and revolved perpetually, night and day, in imitation of the motion of the celestial bodies. The baths were supplied with water from the sea and the Albula. Upon the dedication of this magnificent house, after it was finished, all he said in approval of it was: 'That he had now \"a building fit for a man.\"'\n\n​\n\nIt is said, by Philostratus, that Appolonius of Tyana, when in Babylon, 'visited an apartment belonging to the men, the ceiling of which was domed in the form of the heavens, and covered with sapphire which is a stone of an azure colour resembling the sky. Under this canopy were suspended the images of their reputed deities, wrought in gold, and shedding a light as if from heaven. Here it is where the king sits in judgment. Four golden figures in form of birds are hung from the roof.' It was doubtless in such a place that Ahasuerus sat, god-like, when Esther feared to approach. In Persia, where modern ceilings still imitate the sky, it would seem to be an unbroken tradition from the earliest days. Not a ceiling remains to us from the buildings of Assyria, but it is significant that an inscription reads: 'I caused a ceiling of cedar wood to be made, beautiful as the stars of heaven, adorned with gold.' It is probable that the shrines were lined over the ceiling and walls with lapis lazuli, or blue tiles, as fragments have been found. In Mexico, the shrine represented a star-strewn sky; and in China, the roofs of the sacred buildings of Pekin are covered with azure porcelain.\n\n​\n\nIn the temples of Syria, zodiacs are sculptured on the stone ceilings. The Hindus, in the temples of Orissa, followed the same custom.\n\n​\n\nIn Athens, it is said, in the third cent. B.C. concave ceilings were emblazoned with the heavenly signs. The many fragments we have of Greek ceilings found in excavation, and figured in books, show that they were usually divided into small square panels or coffers, the field of which was blue, each charged with a golden star. The British Museum, and other modern classics, follow this method; sometimes the coffers were slightly concave.\n\n​\n\nA modern ceiling designed with a real feeling for mystery, is that arranged by the Marquis of Bute at Mount Stuart House, where the aspect of the heavens at his birth is correctly set out on the library ceiling.\n\n​\n\nIt is in Egypt that we shall find this dedication of the ceiling to the sky the most completely accepted, and that not only in the temple but in the tomb also; there, on the table of offerings, are food and wine for sustenance, and on its walls are figured all the works of the days of the earthly year and its pastimes; no mere decoration, but a 'double' of the things of earth, so that the dead may suffer no want in his long habitation. Over all is the sky in semblance; the deep blue of night with its stars, cloudless and still; never intended to be seen by other eyes than the eyes of the dead.\n\n​\n\nIn sacred pictures the upper edge of the scene is occupied by the ideogram for sky or ceiling, a horizontal bar with a nib turned down vertically at each end, sometimes blue and the field for a line of stars. 'By the band of stars along the top of each scene, they represented the sky, or the ceiling of the temple, where the ceremony which is made the subject of the picture was supposed to have taken place. In fact, the ceilings of temples are very often decorated with white stars, with a red spot in the middle, scattered on a blue sky; these stars sometimes cover the whole ceiling, and form then the only decoration' (Description de l’Egypt.).\n\n​\n\nThis hieroglyph is also the symbol of the impersonation of the sky, Tpe. Wilkinson says: 'She was a deification of the heaven itself, or that part of the firmament in which the stars are placed; she is sometimes represented under the hieroglyphic character signifying \"the heavens\" studded with stars, and sometimes as a human figure, whose body, as it bends forward with outspread arms, appears to overshadow the earth and encompass it, in imitation of the vault of heaven, reaching from one side of the horizon to the other. In this posture she encloses the zodiacs, as at Esneh and Denderah.'\n\n​\n\nChampollion says: 'The Egyptians compared the sky to the ceilings of an edifice, and those of the greater part of the temples are painted blue, powdered with stars. . . . The goddess of the sky is figured under the form of a woman, whose body, placed horizontally, and out of all proportion long, embraces a large space, circumscribed by the legs and arms, which are vertical. . . . It is to be remarked that the body of the goddess Tpe, shown on the astronomical sculptures, is disposed in a manner to recall the form of the hieroglyph.'\n\n​\n\nSometimes two goddesses are shown, who are thus described by Lenormant: 'Two female figures posed in such a manner that their bodies form, as it were, a flat ceiling, of which the legs and arms are of each end the supports; they are Tpe, the sky, and Nut, the celestial ocean.' The ceiling of the portico at Philæ, figured in the Description of the French Commission, has both these figures extended on the ceiling; their bodies are laid down in profile, with legs and arms bent at right angles to the torso, the Egyptians never drawing the figure in full face until a late time. At Denderah, this difficulty has been surmounted, and the goddess is full face, and particularly well rendered. The third figure, sometimes found, which the over-shadowing goddess touches with finger tips and toes, is Seb, the earth.\n\n​​\n\nIn the first volume of the Description there are other examples given. At Esneh, the ceiling of the portico has one of these figures at each end, perfectly rectangular in form, and the space is filled with zodiacal signs as well as stars. At Erment, three sides of the ceiling are surrounded by one of these figures, the body being drawn out to immense length, and ruled perfectly straight, filling the longitudinal side of the ceiling, which exceeds by three times the ends occupied by the arms and legs.\n\n​\n\nThe ceiling of the portico at Denderah furnishes the most exaggerated example of all. The bodies of the goddesses, covered with the zigzag of water, stretch along the sides, like long streams, on which float lines of stars, the mid-space being occupied by the signs of the zodiac, and other astronomical figures and stars.\n\n \n\nMuch earlier, and by far the most impressive, is that in the tombs of the kings at Thebes, of the great period of the nineteenth dynasty. This nude figure is beautifully proportioned, drawn with the precision of a Greek vase painting, and fearlessly coloured the brightest lapis lazuli blue. The watchful goddess of the sky, all-embracing, lost in the darkness in the farther part of the chamber, peers down from the ceiling, her body bedecked with the planets as bright discs, 'the stars on the body of the heavenly goddess Nut.'\n\n​\n\nThere is another variety of sky ceiling at Denderah. A square apartment has a large circle touching its sides; around an outer zone are the signs of the zodiac, and the central space is filled with the northern constellations.\n\n​\n\nThe simpler form, of stars only, thickly strewn as daisies in a meadow, is the most beautiful representation of 'the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven.' A good coloured plate of one of these is given in Lepsius. On a bright blue sky large white five-rayed stars (why do stars appear to have five rays?), are regularly spaced, almost touching one another. In the middle of every one is a spot of bright red, which, on the white with the surrounding blue, seems to make them dance and flicker before the eyes; others have white stars on an expanse of black, as in the pyramids of Dashour; or, again, the stars may be gold. 'The ceilings of the temples of Thebes had generally a blue ground, upon which vultures, with their great wings outspread, floated among golden stars' (Perrot). Not to give a catalogue of these, we will content ourselves by looking at an early one. In 1881, Maspero opened a pyramid at Sakkarah, belonging to a king, the last Pharaoh of the fifth dynasty. Here, at a time to which no man can number back the years, 'the side walls are covered with fine hieroglyphs, painted green, and the roof sprinkled with stars of the same hue.'\n\n​\n\nLast of all, more pathetic than temple or tomb with their ceilings like the sky, the coffin itself was adorned in the same way. Coffins in the British Museum of a late period have their lids painted on the under side to resemble the sky, a greenish-blue studded with stars; along the margins are the signs of the zodiac in two rows; in the middle of these, longways, is the goddess of the heavens, in full face, white and serene, her eyes for ever looking down into his whom she watches and guards.\n\n​\n\nThese men of Egypt loved the same sky that we also love."

  "title": "The Thundering Tree",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/thundering-tree",
  "content": "If you are a soldier in the American military and you’re looking for the old man on station—the battalion executive officer—you will look for the man with oak leaves on his epaulets. Likewise, when a soldier has received a commendation for a second time (and each successive time thereafter) they receive a cluster of oak leaves in bronze, and then silver to demonstrate as much, pinned on the initial ribbon. It’s not a symbol peculiar to the American armed forces, either. Oak leaves appear in French, German, and British honors up into the most prestigious heights of accolade. Images of the oak’s foliage and its acorns are hung in gold, and brocade across the visor of senior officers; it has been incorporated into the seals and symbols of the military orders across Europe for centuries. In this study we will conduct a brief foray into the history of the military significance of the oak tree, and offer some perspective as to the reason for why this symbol may have gained a degree of prominence in old days.\n\n \n\nAt first glance it will perhaps seem hardly an obvious symbol for martial achievement or station. The oak itself, a green and growing thing, is a far cry from more typical warlike heraldry—of predatory beasts or implements of warfare, for example. All the same, the symbol is an ancient one, and almost ubiquitous to the extent that one might miss the tree for the forest. Oak leaves, laurels, boughs, acorns, and even at times entire tree itself crop up again and again in seals, in heraldry, and in the decorations of soldiery and the states that they protect. No other tree shares this quality, and for that matter, few other elements of iconography do either. Looking backward and wondering how it is that the symbol came to be so pervasive, the first fumbling answers one encounters are simple—simplistic, even. The oak is strong, the wood is hardy and well suited to robust construction; but this attitude toward symbolism is reductive at best and willfully ignorant at worst. In looking for answers, some take it a step further and content themselves with the legend of Old Ironsides, the U.S.S. Constitution and her notoriously impenetrable oaken timbers, and similar vessels that sailed in the republic’s infancy. Considering the relatively recent advent of the nation, this suffices to encompass what is considered to be the relevant history. Naturally, this barely scratches the surface.\n\n​\n\nAs a Roman legionnaire it was possible to receive many awards and boons for distinguished actions on the field of battle. The quintessential image of the Centurion is one with his medals of status adorning his chest atop his armor and wrought in glass, bronze, silver or gold. Yet the highest award to which he, not being a general, could aspire is one made of oak. That being the civic crown, the corona civica which is a wreath made of woven oak leaves and worn upon the head as with the more commonly remembered laurels of athletic prowess. Pliny describes the circumstances around earning the civic crown in exact terms. Firstly, the events had to take place on ground that was held previously by the enemy on the day of the action. Secondly, the soldier in question had to save the life of a roman citizen by slaying his assailant. The nature of the citizen, be he a simple townsman or a senator made no difference, the nature of the award to emphasize roman citizenship on the highest pedestal. Lastly, you must be commended for the award by the man saved, no other testimony or witness will suffice to win the civic crown. The only award of Republican Rome which was regarded a higher honor was the crown of grass, won under similar circumstances, in which an entire besieged army had to acclaim the general of a rescuing force and present him a crown fashioned from the battle field.\n\n​\n\nAchieving the corona civica could raise up the most ignominious man to the heights of Roman society. He was required to wear it to public gatherings where he would be applauded for it even by men far senior to him in age or class and he was permitted entry into the senate chamber. Indeed, winning it rescued one unfortunate soul who, spared death after fighting on the losing side of Sulla’s civil war, seemed destined for a bleak and ignoble career. This, of course, was Julius Caesar.\n\n​\n\nThe record of winners of the civic crown is incomplete, many names lost to history, but we can be assured the earliest civic crown was awarded at least as far back as 455 B.C.E. and likely earlier, the Republic itself only about 50 years older than that and the man recorded regarded a particular hero. His name was Sicinius Dentatus, and he was said to have won the crown 14 times, and several other coronas including the grass crown. Feats of such incredible stature that some historians assume him to be more of a propagandistic figure whose acts were exaggerated. While this author is admittedly hard-pressed to hold that view, it nevertheless does indicate that the award carried enough weight to make his feat particularly notable when compared to previous winners. Either as a politically useful lie or as a true accomplishment, it suggests the origins of the corona civica may belong to an even earlier epoch. Its Roman origin is of sufficient age and venerability that many subsequent militaries seek it out in their own heraldry simply to cut a more Roman figure. The discerning reader will note however, that this does little more than once again push the question back into the deeper and yet murkier waters of history. Why then, did the Romans venerate the oak?\n\n​\n\nPerhaps we ought to simply consider the oak as a fixture of its natural environment, and begin our search for symbolic rationale there. To some extent, the forests of Europe can not really be said to have ever existed with out the civilizing influence of man; with evidence of human intervention in the natural forest as far back as seven thousand years ago and coinciding with the return of the forests with the recession of the glaciers at the end of the ice age. Regardless, in the neolithic era and well into the Roman period, the continent was ruled by forests where now there is sprawling farm land. Those forests were in-turn ruled by the oak tree. In terms of modern classification, the oak is a wide spanning variety of tree primarily defined by the propagation of acorns. The European varieties are typified by slow growth, strong wood and long lives which result in towering height and sprawling, far-reaching canopies. Competition between trees is usually played out in the struggle for access to sunlight. Older trees can stifle others by casting them into shade and depriving them of nourishment. Due to it’s longevity an oak can outlast older trees of other species and thus tends to inherit any glade in which it takes root. Growing taller than the other plant-life and spreading its canopy wide, the oak slowly dominates its competition. The hegemony is so complete that the ebb and flow of the forest has come to be defined by the turning tides of oak trees. Flowers such as bluebell bloom early before deciduous oaks can block the spring sun, others like primrose will stay green year round to gather light in winter and autumn. Shrubs like hazel and hawthorn have developed to grow in partial shade. Unique varieties of fungus depend on the roots of oaks for nutrients, all manner of insects feed on acorns, which are in-turn taken up by birds and beasts of the wood—to such an extent that the breeding cycles for their young are modulated to best take advantage of the seasonal bounty of the oak. Many wasps and beetles are able to propagate only by infesting an oak tree. Other trees are pushed to imperfect ground less-suited to the requirements of an oak, or else to the edges of the forest that the branches of an oak has not yet overgrown.\n\n​\n\nThese facts of the forest must surely have been dominant in the early settlement of Europe, and, acorn meal was then at the very least a staple of sustenance. The connection of course, goes far deeper as one imagines a man crouching before the fire beneath the same oak that sheltered his grandfather’s father. The oak forms a natural gathering place around itself with a wide clearing free from other trees with its broad, sheltering canopy. The dense wood of the oak burns hot and builds well. Further, it will feed you before winter comes. The preeminence of the oak as both a fixture of, and as an embodiment of the land was undeniable.\n\n​\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that the sacred grove was at the heart of the Proto-Indo-European cultures which define Europe. In fact the importance of the grove may even predate the arrival of those peoples—as a fixture of the neolithic practices of the European continent before. Prior to the advent of man-made ritual space; of the temple, the precinct of the gods was a copse of holy trees. As we have seen, in Europe this typically meant specifically a grove of oaks. Therefore, when one wanted to be witnessed by the gods for important events such as forging a marriage, sealing a bond, or when holding political assembly, one went to the sacred grove. Each tree would become associated with a particular deity and thereby blessings and invocations could be conducted with material from the tree in question. For the sake of scope we shall maintain our attention on the gods to which oaks were consecrated.\n\n​\n\nAcross Europe the thunder god bares many names Jupiter, Zeus, Thor, Thunor, Perkuno, Perun, and Taranis each represent the branches of a single cultural tree, which predates the bronze age wave of Proto-Indo-European settlement. As such, they share many similarities; each one of these names is essentially a transliteration of old Proto-Indo-European terms for thunder. The ancient age of the cult of the thunder god is evidenced by in those iterations who share their pantheon with more modern additions. Consider the traditional accoutrements of Thor, when compared to gods such as Freyr or Odin. Thor rides no horse instead going by chariot, and has no sword or armor despite being universally regarded for unmatched strength. When compared with the swords and spears, the glittering armor and legendary steeds of the others, Thor seems a stone age figure. While these thunder gods obviously relate to one another through rule of the sky, they also share the domain of civic order and the compact, embodying civilization by stint of ruling over the other gods. To whit, each of these gods was also venerated across  from the eastern Slavic and Baltic peoples all the way west to Celtic Iberia and Ireland, north from the forests of Germany south into the heart of Rome at the foot of an oak tree.\n\n​\n\nArmed with our general picture of the oak’s ecological character from those preceding observations, it is easy enough to see why it would be directly associated with the sky-gods. Consider the following passage from William Lethaby, concerning the tree as a cosmological model common to the remotest days in antiquity:\n\n​\n\n“The unknown universe could then only be explained in terms of its known parts; the earth, shut in by the night sky, must have been thought of as a living creature, a tree, a tent, a building; and these each form the world system to peoples now living.”\n\n​\n\nThe tree is the prototypical pillar between the heavens and the earth; its canopy supplied primitive man the world-over with one of his earliest analogical models of the sky, and of its structure. On account of the fact that the oak so often stands above all other trees, lightning strikes inevitably favor this tree and tie the sky to the earth with the oak serving as a bridge. Further, because of its robust nature, oak trees often survive being struck by lightning. Doubtless, however, it would burn, and such a flame could smolder for days or even weeks. An oak crowned in this fashion, sometimes called a ‘blasted oak,’ was considered most sacred by ancient observers. The dead upper branches of a stricken tree were sometimes referred to as “stagged” on account of the fact that they appeared like antlers. As an aside, the preference of eagles to roost in tall, dead trees may account in some measure for their long-standing association with thunder deities. Likewise, the presence of parasitic mistletoe was thought to show divine favor—the golden color of its leaves ‘gilded’ the holy oak, and featured prominently in druidic rituals among the Celtic cults.\n\n \n\nRituals and convocations undertaken in sacred groves in honor of the Indo-European thunder gods were built upon the symbolic connections between the sky and the towering oak. It was, for example, a custom around the Baltic Sea and down the Volga, to honor Perkuno, Perun, or Thor with a likeness of that deity in the oak precinct where they were believed to dwell. Their altars were frequently marked by an ever-burning flame (likely in sympathetic imitation of a blasted tree) which was tended by the priests of the grove. Allowing it to be extinguished carried the penalty of death. In some cases, as with the Prussians, the glade was enclosed with curtains draped in order to create an enclosure or sanctum for the god. The curtains could be parted to allow for adherents to view the cult image, but only initiated priests were permitted to trod the holy ground. It’s recorded that the high priest lived within the enclosure, in order that he could listen to the sounds of the tree in windy and stormy conditions, and in this way, interpret the will of the thunderer. The term druid thus literally mans “Oak Knower.” It’s worth noting that ideas about separation between spiritual and corporeal powers were absent; the high priest, the war leader, and the political head may well have often been the same man. It’s little surprise then, that the sacred grove beneath the oak would be the site of political meetings as well as mundane ceremonies like weddings. Taking place beneath the gaze of the oak tree lent metaphysical weight to these proceedings, and to the consequences for deviating from oaths sworn on that sacred ground.\n\n​\n\nIt will perhaps serve to offer some thoughts on the slow cultural transformation from sacred grove to sacred temple. Tacitus recounts of the Germanic tribes that they deemed it inconsistent with the majesty of the gods to confine them with walls. The Greeks and the Romans, by contrast of course, developed elaborate temple typologies—which transmuted elements of the sacred grove into stone; maintaining still fixtures such as the flame, and the cult image. Frequently in the ancient world, temples are shown to have been built atop the old groves, as Livy tells us was the case with the sanctuary of Jupiter in Rome. Elsewhere, we can see transitional moments preserved in the material record—where the temple and the grove coexisted beside one another, as at Upsalla in Sweden. Take for another the temple at Dodona, where Zeus was worshiped as Naios, the god below the oak—or Zeus Boleus, the counselor. The complex at Dodona was extensive; it served at times as a religious capital, and featured a bouleterion for democratic congress, but most notable it was the home of a famous oracle. As with the Prussian tradition, the oracle would listen to the rustling leaves of the holy tree, in order to determine the guidance of Zeus. We might note, too, the similarity between the many columns of Zeus (as at Lykaion, for example, forming a solar portal) and traditional Saxon Irminsul, a sacred pillar covered in carvings, which may also be taken as representative of the movement from wild sacred space, to sacred edifices designed and built by men.\n\nThe transformation from grove to temple is not well-documented at every step, particularly on account of the fact that the evidence was often destroyed as part of Christian conversion efforts. The acts of these saints are sometimes helpfully recorded, however, as with the sacred trees desecrated and destroyed by Bishop Otto, Saint martin, and Saint Boniface—showing us that many of these sacred groves and images managed to survive in-tact late into the Medieval period in some areas of Europe. In some cases, the destruction of the temples were met with equanimity by adherents, but they begged to be spared the destruction of the groves—the people saying that without them, they would not know where to seek the gods.\n\n​\n\nOf course as we know the Christian efforts were largely successful, and it was destined to become the dominant religious force on the continent for a thousand years. Though, typically with conversion efforts it’s often the path of least resistance to incorporate certain aspects of iconography rather than eliminate them. The case is no different with ideas like that of the holy cross being made of oak, despite is rarity in the Levant, or as with the acorn becoming a symbol of the rebirth of Christ—these things are examples of a broad process of inculturation which adapted to oak and many old symbols, stories, and ideas into objects of Christian utility.\n\n​\n\nRegardless, use of the oak as an important witness in one way or another persisted. Low-born weddings conducted under oak trees, often on Thursday (þunresdæg) survived even into the modern era. Oaks are traditionally planted and adopted by royalty, in order to incorporate the symbol into their dynasty, or, in some cases to celebrate its continuity. Such is the case with the British royal oak, which served as a royal savior and shelter during the civil war. The necessity of strong oak groves experienced a resurgence during the age of the sail, and a songwriter took up Virgil’s words describing the Celts, writing of a \"race of men from tree-stocks spring and stubborn hearts of oak.” That song was fashioned into an official tune of the royal Navy. And so, we come full circle to the question of modern military iconography.\n\n​\n\nRecall on the one hand, the oracle of Zeus at Dodona—surely a thunder-god, but also Naios, of the oak, and Bouleus, for the councils. Consider as well on the other hand, that the hammer of Thor is used in the Þrymskviða to officiate a wedding, and by reference, an assembly. The Roman Senate, as if in accord, elected to assemble in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. As we have seen, the oak symbolizes not only the sky and the immutable strength embodied in the thunder gods, but also the perpetually burning flame of civilization—which must be kept. For thousands of years, just as high priest and chieftain were little distinguished, the state and the grove could be taken reflexively for the same entity. In other words, the nation embodied in the sacred ground beneath the canopy of the oak tree—the oaths sworn, and the laws made there—were identified with one another. What better garland to bless the protectors of the sacred grove and the land of its people, than one woven from the leaves and boughs of the sky-god’s tree? The oak is thus emblematic of the nation in a most tangible sense. It is therefore according to this broad, and ancient train of thought that we owe the tradition of consecrating our soldiery with affects of the oak tree: To honor their defense of the most holy expression of their realm."

  "content": "Introduction \n\n \n\nPerhaps the most distant ancestor of all spiritual ideas is the simple notion that the outward nature of a thing—its appearance, its manner, it's motion—is governed by and is therefore exemplary of some inner volition; some will to order, or animating principle. One sees all others in precisely these terms. The concept of the soul for the ancients neatly symbolized the in-dwelling aspects of man. Life and motion were taken to be synonymous by natural philosophers of the pre-industrial ages. Even the up-reaching growth of vegetative life seemed to belie some inner, invigorating force. In truth many spiritual systems are alloys of this simple tenet. That the esoteric (or strictly, ‘inner’) principle can be understood through careful scrutiny of its outward form is the foundation shared by the myriad schools of physiognomy, and of divination. This idea has long linked the architect to the hierophant. In pouring over the histories, the doctrine of macrocosm and microcosm—so common to man of antiquity—emerges time and again. It is an inevitable current, which is produced by the movements of our 'first' qualitative idea. \n\n \n\nAs the form of the body and the form of the temple were both models of the cosmos, so was the hand itself—the \"instrument of instruments,\" Aristotle called it—a microcosmic emblem. Chiromantic tradition postulates numerous sympathies between the form of the hand and the sky, and as well, between the form of the hand and the body at large. Some brief notes may suffice: The circle of the sky is identified in the vola, or thenar; in the palm of the hand. The zodiacal divisions in the heavens are reflected by the twelve phalanges of the four fingers. Graven on the palm from the moment of birth is a complex latticework of lineaments, unique to each individual, and in them the ancients saw shapes analogous to horoscopic arrangements drawn across the dome of heaven. The hand is thus the prototypical sigil; the runic circle, an earthly exemplum governed by proportion to the celestial exemplar. As a curious aside, if the reader will permit, we might note as well that the sigillary hand—that is, some esoteric principle rendered in the bodily clay—in all likelihood directs us toward the symbolic root of the earthly disk, or pentacle of the tarot. In any case, all that we intend to say here at the outset is that for the ancients, one’s hand evidently expressed something about the inner nature of the individual to whom it belonged. With a skilled eye it followed through no great leap that systematic study of those mundane symbols might yield some esoteric knowledge. That knowledge was eventually marshaled into an art. In this way, in some age now lost, chiromancy was born. \n\n \n\nIn this series of studies we continue to constrain our focus to the symbolic character of each individual finger. Following on from the first, or index finger we now turn our attention to the second, or middle finger. Medieval, Renaissance, and Victorian written traditions in European palmistry record in unwavering tone that the middle finger was connected symbolically both to Saturn in the sky, and to the Spleen in the body. This symbolic triad can be compared to the Forefinger-Jupiter-Liver grouping. And so, we will attempt (as ever) to clarify the underlying rationale that produced those associations. Such things for the ancients are, as I have remarked elsewhere, never arbitrary, and always conceived in accordance with some qualitative reasoning. As we continue to investigate the Indo-European symbolism of the hand, the cynical attitude of modern scholars—that the Chiromantic tradition in Europe is essentially foreign; introduced from an Arabian source no earlier than the twelfth century, and was modeled on ideas autochthonous to India—becomes less and less tenable. Modern scholarship simply does not adequately account for the degree to which those Medieval sources align with the much wider, and more ancient systems of Proto-Indo-European metaphysics that inarguably connect the Vedic cultures to their fountainhead on the Pontic Caspian steppe.\n\n \n\nIn his 1658 treatise on the principles of Chiromancy, Marin Cureau de la Chambre writes at some appreciable length on the connection between the middle finger and the spleen. The character of this treatise is, naturally, something of a product of its time in the sense that its primary aim is to justify traditional Chiromantic ideas with medical theory, and with surgical anecdotes. Concerned not directly with the symbolic character of the hand, de la Chambre rather proceeds having taken those things for granted. This in-and-of-itself signals to the reader that the middle finger and spleen associations (among others) were, even in that time, viewed as a ‘given.’ Such ideas were it seems, already old.\n\n \n\n“I could add for a third observation,” writes de la Chambre, “The sympathy betwixt the spleen and the middle-finger, the wonderful effects which the opening of the Salvarella produceth in the diseases of the spleen: For this vein commonly betwixt the middle and the third finger, as Hippocrates saith … that the virtue of the spleen is through that vein carried to that finger…” Contemporaneously with this manuscript, Richard Saunders defined the middle finger in his seminal treatise on physiognomy and chiromancy. He wrote: “This finger is Saturn.” \n\n \n\nTurning the hand over to observe the lines in the palm, if only for the moment—a thorough analysis of these features’ symbolic heritage remains out ahead of us—we would point out that the line which divides the palm vertically in half; beginning at the rascetta in the wrist and extending up toward the middle finger, has from the very earliest traditions, been named the line of Saturn. \n\n \n\nIt seems most prudent to first approach the spleen (and its association with black bile) and to question the role that both played in ancient medical philosophy. These systems of thought trace their roots at the very least to the humoral theory of Hippocrates, on to Galen, and down through their many disciples. With a clearer picture of the melancholic character of the spleen, we can properly approach the question of the middle finger, and of Saturn: How did it come to pass that Medieval and Renaissance mystics took this finger as the chiromantic instantiation of the Saturn-spleen idea? The answer lies waiting beneath the fact that both the middle finger and the spleen have, from a very early date, been deeply enmeshed in taboo.\n\n \n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nHumoralism\n\n \n\nIn order to understand the archaic picture of the spleen, we will have to begin with a survey of the relevant aspects of the humoral theory of medicine—which dominated curative thought in Europe for millennia. It was according to developments in this theory that individual organs became identified with individual humors; the spleen to black bile specifically. The general seed of the humoral idea is this: The health of the human body is the result of the balance of four vital fluids, or “humors,” and that illness or disease is the result of their imbalance. \n\n \n\nThe origins of this theory are to be found in a classical Greek text titled ‘On the Nature of Man,’ which was written no later than the fifth century BCE, and was authored (according to Galen) either by Hippocrates himself or by his son-in-law, Polybus. In either case the brilliance of this document belongs to its author's ability to holistically incorporate what were, up until that point in time, disconnected elements of natural philosophy and empirical medicine. Prior to the appearance of this treatise physicians postulated many different humors in the body. It wasn’t until the Pythagorean notion was established in the philosophical milieu--of the special significance of the number four--that a set of four humors became the ideal. In the Pythagorean fragments the sacred tetrad is defined with clarity and conviction: The number four “holds the root and source of eternal nature.” Advancing a number of essential tetrads; the seasons, the elements, the cycle of ages, the ages of man, the dactyls, etc., the Pythagoreans laid the first flagstone on the path to the fourfold doctrine of Hippocrates. A few more stones were necessary, which were provided in short order, culminating with the author of that treatise. In their highly influential work on the subject, authors Saxl, Panofsky, and Klibansky describe the progression of these philosophical ideas into the humoral theory of medicine so neatly that it's hardly worth paraphrasing:\n\n \n\n\"The notion of the humors as such comes from empirical medicine. The notion of the tetrad, the definition of health as the equilibrium of the different parts, and of sickness as the disturbance of the equilibrium, are Pythagorean contributions. The notion that in the course of the seasons each of the four substances in turn gains ascendancy seems to be purely Empedocles. But the credit for combining all these notions in one system, and thereby creating the doctrine of humoralism ... is no doubt due to the powerful writer who composed the first part of On the Nature of Man. This system included not only the Pythagorean and Empedoclean tetrad but also the doctrine of the qualities that Philistion handed down to us ... From this the author of On the Nature of Man evolved the following schema, which was to remain in force for more than two thousand years:\" \n\n \n\nBlood, Spring, Warm and Moist\n\nYellow Bile, Summer, Warm and Dry\n\nBlack Bile, Autumn, Cold and Dry\n\nPhlegm, Winter, Cold and Moist\n\n \n\nAs they state, the idea of humors itself comes from empirical medicine. That is to say, the existence of in-dwelling bodily fluid is simply an empirical observation. But, upon closer inspection, one of those humors presents an issue even at this level. Two are self explanatory—blood and phlegm, well and good. Yellow bile is perhaps less obvious to the scrutiny of a modern layman, but nevertheless, it is present and empirically demonstrable. Yellow bile was viewed as a secretion of the liver, and it is not particularly difficult to imagine that ancient observers may have conflated it with stomach acids, in episodes of vomiting. The acidic taste is in fact the source of the Greek word for yellow bile as well, but more in due course. These three humors are thus readily produced by physicians. Identifying a fourth humor, however, is a bit trickier. And it is for that reason that black bile has been characterized as a ‘notional’ humor by many academics, and rightly so. The physician in antiquity would have been faced with three visible humors, and as well, with the philosophical idea that the body ought to be properly characterized by a tetrad. This principle was treated most seriously in the post-Pythagorean world. And so, the existence of a fourth humor was likely deduced ipso facto for natural philosophers. Black bile was thus conjured up to fill the role of the final humor, and its qualities were assured on account of the fact that the cold and dry pairing of Alcmaeon and Philistion had not yet found its humoral analogue, and so, must of-necessity characterize the fourth.\n\n \n\nNow, the discerning reader might take pause to wonder, and raise the question: Surely there are other, more obvious bodily fluids that could have been identified for a humor. Saliva, urine, seminal fluid etc—are not any of these more evident than postulating an ‘invisible’ fourth humor? And yet, recall that the humors served a more specific purpose in early medical theory. They were not merely building blocks of the body; the elements served that function. The humors were elemental analogues. Their role, their principle role, was to account for good and for ill health in the bodily system. Proper accord between the humors resulted in κρᾶσις (krasis), or ‘balance.’ Imbalance between them, favoring one above the others, was believed to result in sickness and in disease. In this way, we can append the observation that for a bodily fluid to work as a humor at all, it must occasion to present itself as symptomatic of some illness. This is a requirement that cannot easily be met by urine, or saliva, or seminal fluid, etc. Phlegm, blood, and yellow bile all share this quality, they are all in turn expressed as symptomatic in the course of illness and disease. Thus they lend themselves quite nicely to the notion that the body is expelling an excess of some vital fluid; that it's accounting for an inner unevenness. And if this is the case, we would expect for black bile to be traceable to a similar symptomatic expression. If we take a moment to interrogate the name that the Greeks gave to this fourth humor, that expression will be clarified as well.\n\n \n\nMelancholia in the original Greek is rendered ‘μελάγχολος' from μέλας and χόλος. As for the second component, kholos, this word is translated most commonly as ‘bile,’ and figures into the form of yellow bile’s Greek name as well. In other words, black bile is termed an alternate form of yellow bile. Indeed in the early physiological texts, black bile is theorized to be a degenerated form, or a state of yellow bile. Nevertheless the word ‘bile’ has a different root, isolated to Latin and of peripheral concern to the Greek consideration at hand. We will set the issue of the word ‘bile’ aside. Kholos can be translated to ‘gall’ as well, the meaning of which is down to the bitterness or acidity of the yellow humor. Yellow bile, then, is the bitter yellow fluid in name, and black bile is its blackened counterpart. \n\n \n\nBut what of the first component—melas? This word, although commonly translated as ‘black’ in a humoral context, more nearly means ‘bruised,’ and can be taken in different contexts to refer to black, or to dark, or to blue. Thus, we might argue that the color of black bile reveals a symptomatic expression that was endemic to its initial conception: bruising. To press this point a moment further, recall the qualitative associations furnished by the author of the Hippocratic treatise—black bile has always been associated with coldness and with dryness. These two qualities explicitly define the βροτός (vrotos), the ‘blood outside,’ in contrast to the warm and moist ‘blood-inside,’ the θυμός (thumos). We explored the Proto-Indo-European notion of two-bloodedness in our study of the forefinger, and so, must content ourselves only to nod in that direction for the moment in order to maintain some semblance of scope. As the blood slows, cools, and dries it also blackens, a simple observation that lies in qualitative accord with the Hippocratic picture of a fourth humor; the cold and dry humor which bruises and discolors thus would have appeared verified by the mystical picture of the cooling, drying, and blackening of the blood. We are reminded of a remark in Cioran, that the melancholic is characterized by his \"slow blood.\" It’s worth noting as well, that in the later Hippocratic tradition the black bile was considered at times to be conveyed within the blood, or even to be a sedimentitious component of it. As a matter of fact, all of the humors have been thought at one time or another, to be conveyed throughout the body together with the blood by way of venous and arterial lineaments. \n\n \n\nHere we ought to direct the reader's attention to a rather brilliant observation made by Ingvar Johansson and Niels Lynöe in their book \"Medicine and Philosophy: A Twenty-First Century Introduction.\" What follows is, perhaps in its entirety, the material or empirical aspect of the humoral system. It is not hard to imagine this process being carried out by physicians of old to demonstrate all four in one simple experiment, though, the reader is advised to bear in mind that without the metaphysical context in which ancient man would have rationalized such a demonstration, the ‘what’ will remain entirely bereft of the ‘why.’ In any case, the authors explain:\n\n \n\n“If blood is poured into a glass jar, a process of coagulation and sedimentation starts. It ends with four clearly distinct layers: a red region, a yellowish one, a black one, and a white one.  … The lowest part of the same column consists of sediment that is too dense to permit light to pass through. Therefore this part of the column looks black and might be referred to as ‘black bile.’ On the top of the column there is a white layer, which today we would classify as fibrin; it might correspond to Galen’s phlegm. The remaining part is a rather clear but somewhat yellowish fluid that surrounds the coagulated column in the middle. It might be called ‘yellow bile,’ but today we recognize it as blood serum.”\n\n \n\nEach of these four humors, as we have said—if the cause of imbalance in the body—resulted in some form of illness. Those illnesses were gathered up under the umbrellas of their associated humor. Thus a ‘melancholic’ excess might be susceptible to a variety of melancholic sicknesses. The same could be said of a sanguine excess, and so on. And yet, with relative celerity it seems to have become apparent to the natural philosophers that a true and proper balance of all four humors was an unattainable ideal. No physician could furnish a man in perfect, flawless health. For this reason we can understand how the humoral doctrine began to shift from diagnoses toward dispositions; toward temperamental archetypes. While they still accounted for their associated sicknesses, such conditions were viewed not as excesses beyond balance, but as excesses beyond the normal excess which produced in men their different temperaments. \n\n \n\nMelancholy in particular enjoyed special treatment by Ancient Greek writers before all the rest. In the melancholic, the ancients recognized something of the frenzy and the reckless tragedy, that typifies all paragons of the Indo-European spirit. Looking to Gellius, we find melancholy aptly described as a “disease of heroes.” In the Phaedrus, Socrates discusses the Platonic idea of frenzy, distinguishing it from base evil: “but in fact we receive the greatest benefits through frenzy,\" he says, \"that is, in so far as it is sent as a divine gift.” Plato does not connect this idea to melancholy himself, however. For him, melancholy is a moral madness; a hallmark of tyranny. We will return to this notion at some length once we arrive at the issue of Saturn. \n\n \n\nSaxl, Panofsky, and Klibansky explain the development of melancholic heroism in Aristotle, writing that it was he who “first brought about the union between the purely medical notion of melancholy, and the Platonic conception of frenzy. This union found expression in what for the Greeks was the paradoxical thesis that not only the tragic heroes like Ajax, Heracles, and Bellerophon, but really all outstanding men, whether in the realm of the arts or in those of poetry, philosophy or statesmanship—even Socrates and Plato—were melancholics.” In fact there is a text to be found in the Aristotelian corpus, titled Problem XXX I, which has been referred to by scholars as the first monograph on melancholy. In this text, Aristotle identifies black bile as the source not just of a kind of debilitating sadness and lethargy, but also potentially of ecstatic madness; of true genius. This duality between brilliance and ruin defined melancholia well into the Victorian age. \n\n \n\nRather than continue to probe the nature of melancholia—a colossal task which is, quite frankly, among the most well-trodden fields in the realm of academic art history, we will recall to the forefront a number of foregoing points that set the stage for the task at hand; for drawing the middle finger into its proper place in that symbolic landscape. First, that black bile is the source of melancholia. Second, that melancholia came to exemplify the temperamental blade’s edge between genius and lunacy; of the shared root that provides both a capacity for heroism, and a capacity for tyranny. To these two items we will add now a third. According to Hippocratic and Galenic tradition, the organ in the body which rules over black bile is the spleen. \n\n \n\nWe say ‘rules over’ to simplify the issue somewhat, here, for across history the spleen has been thought by some to produce this humor, by others to separate it out from the blood or from the body at large; to filter it, etc. Regardless, what has remained certain from Hippocrates down to 18th century medicine was the singular principle that black bile was of special significance to the spleen. And so our question now becomes: What did the ancients make of the spleen?\n\n \n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Spleen\n\n \n\nPrior to modern medicine, the question of the spleen’s function in the body seems quite plainly to have baffled many physicians. Beginning in the Hippocratic corpus, it was believed that the spleen served to draw water off of the body. This of course coincides with the early notion that the fourth humor was water, rather than black bile—and so we might conclude that even before the arrival black bile onto the theoretical scene, the spleen was still considered to rule over the fourth humor. Plato, in the Timaeus gives us further clues—stating that the spleen’s function is to “maintain the liver bright and pure.” In other words, the spleen’s role was to cleanse the liver; somehow it ‘drew off’ corrupting substances from the nobler organ. Although the Alexandrian texts are lost, Galen tells us that Erasistratus considered the spleen to be an entirely useless organ. Six hundred years after Hippocrates, Celsus wrote that the spleen was an “entirely unknown organ, whose task is to pour melancholy humors of the blood through the splenogastric vessels.” In Galen’s own writing, the spleen attracts and eliminates melancholy during the processes of transmuting in-taken sustenance, into both blood by the liver, and by the other organs into the substances of their own constituent tissues.\n\n \n\nContinuing to scour the histories, splenetick speculation strays down even stranger corridors. Athletes apparently viewed runners’ stitches as caused by the spleen no-doubt on account of their common position in the general area of that organ. Pliny explains that “The Viscus (spleen) has the characteristic of slowing down the race of men, for this reason, runners were subordinated to its burn with a red-hot iron.” The surgical removal of the spleen was, as well, not unknown in antiquity. Coupled with its apparent ‘uselessness’ for some, and its role as an athletic villain, it was even postulated by some physicians that those who underwent, and recovered from splenectomy could run faster as a result of the removal of that organ. \n\n \n\nOn the subject of splenectomy performed in antiquity, physicians would immediately have noted that it is entirely possible for a human being to survive without a spleen. The ancients were obviously aware of this fact. They surely would not have considered it unremarkable. Because the spleen’s actual function in the body is related to the immune system, many who die as a result of splenectomy suffer that fate specifically because they contract an unrelated illness afterward, which their immune system cannot fight off without the aid of the spleen. It’s entirely likely that the ancients would have observed a patients’ recovery, and fine constitution following a splenectomy, and should he perish as a result of a subsequent illness they might mistakenly (though understandably) blame the illness, rather than understanding that it was the absence of the spleen which rendered him deathly susceptible. By the 16th century even the celebrated polymath Paracelsus added his thoughts on the subject, proclaiming that the spleen was a completely superfluous organ which ought to be excised when diseased. Likewise, we read that the physician Vesalius performed many splenectomies on various animals, supporting as it were the notion that whatever the spleen was, it was not essential to life. \n\n \n\nFrom this confluence of ideas we can gather that the spleen was taken to be a dormant, or even malevolent influence; ‘subordinating’ the athletic potential of the body. The ancient picture of the spleen thus vacillated from assisting the liver, to utter uselessness, and even to outright harm.  And yet throughout all of this speculation, even when the ancient authors labeled the spleen as an ‘unknown’ organ, nevertheless, all remained in firm accord that the spleen must interact with the melancholic humor. The prevailing sentiment emerges that it drew-off excess melancholia from the bodily system. It is in Aristotle (at last) that we discover a most poetic description of the spleen, which, after much consideration, appears to mark the proper path through this great storm of symbolism. In his treatise on the Parts of Animals, Aristotle calls the spleen a ‘counterfeit, or bastard liver.’ At first glance this line may give one to furrow their brows—what could Aristotle mean by a ‘bastardized,’ or false liver? \n\n \n\nTo uncover the answer to this question we will have to examine the words with which the ancients named the spleen. This word ‘spleen’ is lent to modern English from the Greek σπλήν, which descends in turn from a Proto-Indo-European root, *splǵʰ-. The reader will take care to note that the PIE formulation does not contain the long ‘e’ sound which persisted unchanged in derivative forms, all the way to modern English. The literal meaning of this root is hard to place. It appears translated only as ‘spleen.’ An alternative descendant of the same word is simplified, ‘‘lien, -enis.’ The long ‘e,’ present here as well, is attested by two grammarians (Servius and Priscian) in the works of the 4th century writer Serenus, at least. Philological consensus holds that the Proto-Indo-European root *splǵʰ- was replaced by *(s)liǵʰ, on account of the fact that the prior form was believed to be taboo—a process termed metathesis. The specific model for introducing the long ‘e’ remains an open question. \n\n \n\nTo simplify a bit, then: In the original tongue of the Pontic-Caspian speaking peoples, the organ was called *splǵʰ. This name and by extension the organ itself was taken for taboo—which tells us that even in those days, the spleen was viewed as bad-natured, baleful, dangerous, or to quote Aristotle, “bastardized, counterfeit.” Owing to this nature, the pronunciation of the word was metathesized in descendant tongues, to incorporate a long ‘e’ sound, in order to avoid invoking the taboo associated with vocalizing the true name. We see this  process play out time and again in the ancient world. Take for example the Greek word for wolf—which should be ulkos—but was metathesized to lukos. The same can be observed in the Latin word lupus (ulpus).\n\n \n\nNow, into this set of concerns we will add one further. When it was introduced to the low Germanic languages, the word spleen displaced a different name for that organ: Milt.  This word, curiously, was used both to refer to the spleen and, in certain contexts, to the seminal fluid and/or testes of male fish. And while this may cause the reader to tilt their head, we will set that second meaning aside for the moment—returning to it in due course in the context of Saturn. In Middle English this word was milte, from the Old English milt, which in Proto-Germanic was rendered *melto. In all likelihood this alternate designation for the spleen was an idiomatic name offered instead of the taboo—descending from the Proto-Indo-European root *(s)meld- to ‘weaken’ or ‘melt,’ related no doubt to *(s)meld- 'to beat,’ ‘to grind,’ or ‘to crush.’ While at first it may seem incongruent to refer to the spleen as a beaten or weakened organ, nevertheless there is something here quite clearly in alignment with the spirit of Aristotle’s notion of the spleen as counterfeit or bastardized in some way. Recalling our consideration of the linguistic origins of black bile’s ‘blackness,’ so to speak, as a darkening, blue-blackening, or bruising humor in the most remote sense, we can finally offer a possible solution to the puzzle. \n\n \n\nIt’s well-known that the ancients believed not just that the liver was the source of blood in some traditions; as the seat of the soul and the source of life—but further that the physical tissue of the liver was blood. The liver seemed to ancient observers to be different from the tissue of other organs in the body; and so saturated with blood it was not a far leap to conclude that the very substance of that organ was blood. The spleen, as it happens, appears to be made up of a very similar tissue. Further, the spleen is not red in coloration, as the liver is; rather the healthy spleen is a deeper, purplish hue. That is, ‘discolored;’ we might easily say that the spleen appears to be a diminutive, bruised liver. Housed on the left, sinister, or weakened side of the body it is thus compositionally obverse to the larger, redder, right-dwelling liver. This qualitative line of reasoning is borne out with clarity, as we have seen, in the philological sphere—throughout the Indo-European traditions. So we contend that it was according to this deeply ancient thought process that the spleen has, from the earliest moments, been identified as the ruler of the melancholic humor, and the source of the melancholic temperament. This is the fountainhead of self-evidence, wherein the spleen and melancholia converge. The spleen draws off the poisonous substances from the rest of the body and so, in time it became both the cleanser of the liver for some, while for others it became synonymous with those toxic substances, even becoming their source. That is the root of the Aristotelian notion that the spleen was a bastard liver: it was the house of taboo in the bodily system. It’s no small wonder then, that the spleen would be given over in a chiromantic sense to the middle finger; the digit of taboo in the hand—digitus infamis, or digitus impudicus as it was called by the Romans. \n\n \n\nTo linger a moment longer, we will point out as well that the the etymological heritage of the name ‘milt’ (*(s)mel-) converges with the Greek formulation melas or melancholia, *mel-, which releases us into a much broader linguistic sea of related terms that swirl around these elemental concepts, all of which reinforce one another, and assure us of our ancestors' propensity for, and great love of qualitative interconnectedness: Malevolence, malady, and from various derivatives falseness, erroneousness, evil; even the Latin \"Oculus Malus,\" or the evil eye, comprises this root. The Greek melas was also not constrained to the demarcation of a bruised hue, or black-blue coloration. This word enjoyed a wide array of apparently idiomatic literary attributions—it was commonly used to indicate tyranny, and so again, we brush up against the Saturnian question: for it was Saturn who castrated, and overthrew the first tyrant.\n\n \n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nFascinus\n\n \n\nIt’s no secret that the middle finger has for centuries been identified as a phallic symbol. Any charlatan among palmists will delight to say as much. Raising this finger and curling the rest on either side into the palm produces a form which is unmistakably reminiscent of the phallus and testes. \n\n \n\nIn Classical antiquity this gesture was called ‘katapygon,’ formed of kata, or downward, and puge, or the buttocks. Which is to say, offering the middle finger was a gesture of insult then much in the same way it is now, today in the west. Famously, Diogenes is said to have offered his middle finger in insult to the orator Demosthenes in the 4th century BCE. In Aristophanes’ comedy The Clouds, one character even extends his middle finger during a discussion about poetic meter, which is apparently a double pun in the sense that the ‘daktyloi’ when scanned, (long, short, short) creates a phallic form as well. Isidore of Seville repeats, in his Etymologiae, the name “shameless finger” according to the same popular usage.  \n\n \n\nLittle more than this is typically said. If one is keen to look into the history of the gesture as an insult, accounts of these classical items—which only verify our simplistic modern idea about this finger—can be trotted out, as if to close the book on the question. It’s an affronting image, and so the finger is an affronting finger. Usually some petty, free-associative warbling might be pried from speculators, if pressed even further—being an insulting gesture, and so an insulting finger, we can associate it loosely with all of the poetic ill-temper befit of a saturnine or melancholic disposition. Probably on account of all this modern nonsense did Paul Hamlyn lament in his fantastic volume on chiromantic practice that the middle finger \"has always been the palmists' headache.\" So it seems.\n\n \n\nUnsatisfied as we are with such a flimsy analysis, and irritated by its commonality, the reader will perhaps agree that such an argument ignores the large body of symbolic thinking, which we have just laid out. In his survey of the use of gesture in healing rituals, Herbert Fischer notes of the middle finger that a “vulgar literature had for definite reasons already degraded it to digitus infamis.” Although any investigation into what came before that degradation is absent his scope, we nevertheless find ourselves in accord with the sentiment. Surely there is more to the chiromantic association of the infamous finger with the philosophical picture of the spleen. Can we not say with conviction that both are taboo, and so some sympathetic linkage must persist between them the roots of which are buried in that soil? If there is, we would expect the middle finger to fit neatly into the foregoing tapestry of splenetick and melancholic symbolism so carefully curated by man of antiquity. And so we do.\n\n \n\nParallel to the traditional usage of the middle finger for a phallic insult, there are many traditions as well that hold both this dactyl and the phallus to be apotropaic symbols—of specific use in averting the evil eye. In Plutarch, we find the figure Patrocleas who explains the evil eye in this manner:\n\n \n\n“Envy, which naturally roots itself more deeply in the mind than any other passion, contaminates the body too with evil. When those possessed by envy to this degree let their glance fall upon a person, their eyes, which are close to the mind and draw from it the evil influence of the passion, then assail that person as if with poisoned arrows; hence, I conclude it is not paradoxical or incredible that they should have an effect on the persons who encounter their gaze. … What I have said shows why the so-called amulets are thought to be a protection against envy; the strange look of them attracts the gaze, so that it exerts less pressure upon its victims.”\n\n \n\nIn his second satire, Persius briefly describes a woman concocting just such a charm to ward off the evil eye using the middle finger and saliva—which was also thought to have special potency in this respect. He writes that “with her middle finger, and propitiatory saliva, she [was] skilled at warding off that evil eye that withers …” \n\n \n\nParticularly vulnerable to the effects of the evil eye were children and infants. And so it was the case in Rome that many young children and adolescents would commonly wear necklaces hung with pendants fashioned in the shape of a phallus, or a winged phallus. Rings were also common, many having been discovered that are too small for the hand of an adult. Winged phalluses also adorned doorways and portals, and sometimes took the form of wind chimes (tintinnabula)—all in effort to distract and detract from the potency of the evil eye; so ubiquitous in the ancient world. The word ‘fascinate’ descends from the Latin name for these amulets and charms: The fascinus, on account of its power to captivate the evil eye. \n\n \n\nSo we understand that the middle finger’s apotropaic usage was likely down to the fact that it shared a sympathetic form with the fascinus; it isn't difficult to imagine that should one have found himself the object of another’s hateful gaze, absent a charm, he might extend his middle finger in the form of the fascinus in response. After all, is this not how we today still use the middle finger—often in reply to hateful attention or a pointed and poisonous look? Or in other words, as if our intention was to ward against it? Taking this on board then, we must continue by questioning why it was that the phallus was believed to perform such a function at all, in the first place. \n\n \n\nSome relatively recent writers have even gone so far as to suggest the power of the fascinus over the evil eye was down to the ability of laughter and ridicule to neutralize ill intentions. And while this may prove a sufficient explanation for many a giddy modern reader, sporting an appreciable appetite for kitsch, it's the opinion of this author that it would be an entirely insufficient explanation for any learned man of antiquity--such was simply not his disposition. Whimsy has never belonged in the temple. No, there must be a qualitative mechanism; a certain inherence at play. Only on those grounds do symbolic ideas successfully persist through time even when a proper understanding of their purpose has long since passed out of mind. They must seem consistent, even to the uneducated observer. The mechanism of the fascinus and its relation to Saturn is, upon some reflection, most likely to be found in the agrarian origin of that deity. The phallic symbol is above all simply a symbol of life; of creation, generation, and propagation. In this sense, it is the natural enemy of the evil eye--of destruction, and of ruin, and of decay. The agrarian symbolism of Saturn must color the magical power of the fascinus, and thus naturally counteracts that which “withers.”\n\n \n\nBefore we move on to introducing the Saturnine dimension of our train of reasoning, recall that the Spleen was often characterized as an apotropaic organ, drawing off the black bile or melancholic substances from the body. In this sense, its microcosmic identification with the middle finger follows naturally, as the phallic symbol was independently a warding symbol against the evil eye. At times, then, the spleen was seen to draw off bad influence, or to be a bastard object itself (as in Aristotle), perhaps in a similar fashion to the way in which the katapygon has been interpreted both as insulting and protective in different contexts, and at different times.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nSaturn\n\n \n\nPaul Hamlyn devotes some time in his brief treatment of the middle finger, toward separating the morbidity and the chaff from Victorian chiromantic ideas about Saturn. “Independently of his astrological trimmings,” he writes, “Saturn was the son of Coelus and Gaia, the Earth goddess, and was, in terms of mythology, largely instrumental in civilizing the people of Italy, introducing agriculture and various arts at a time when they were largely barbarians.” We find an accord between this agrarian picture of Saturn’s origin and the sedemintitious or ‘earthy’ nature of the black bile, and by extension the seat of Saturn in the body: The spleen. \n\n \n\nThe name of Saturn has been subject to a considerable amount of philological speculation. The Latin Saturnus is thought most likely to be lent from the Etruscan satre, and been combined with the similar Latin formulation ‘satus,’ being a past participle of serere, or, ‘to sow.’ The issue, however, is that the long ‘a’ doesn’t seem to fit well with that particular root. Thus the suggestion becomes—reasonably enough—that it was combined with the Latin according to some mechanism. Regardless of the particulars it is a certainty that the character of this mythological figure was in his early days as Hamlyn notes: more or less agricultural. \n\n \n\nBecause of this, we can begin to understand at a much broader level the meaning encoded in the myth of the castration of Ouranos by Kronos-Saturn. The fascinus is taken as a symbol for life; for procreation, for regeneration, quite literally that which imbues the earth with its vivifying principle or spiritus. Recall the Indo-European idea that in the union of man and woman, it is woman who provides the bodily clay—i.e. plays the role of Gaia—and it is the man in turn who provides the anima, the role of Ouranos. In suffering castration at the hands of Kronos-Saturn, we witness the divestment of the power to perpetuate the cycle of harvest, of season, of age, and at a most fundamental level to ensure the posterity of his people from Ouranos. Kronos-Saturn thus takes the mandate for himself, symbolically in the form of the fascinus, from which the mythological tradition tells us the first race of Titans were born. The story of Ouranos and Kronos is, therefore, clearly read as a prototype of the antagonism between the oculus malus and the fascinus. The middle finger is thus offered as one of many symbolic instantiations of the fascinus, and Saturn’s proper place as the ruler of that dactyl is clarified. \n\n \n\nAs a final note, we will turn our attention to a strange but brilliant article which first appeared published pseudonymously by the Italian mathematician and esotericist Arturo Reghini, in 1927. Writing for the controversial UR Gruppo under the pseudonym Pietro Negri (assumed in nod to the 17th century painter of the same name), Reghini speculated on the origin of the name Saturn. He posits that the phoneme Sat- which, recall, is not properly explained even now by philological consensus, can be understood through linkage to the Sanskrit branch of the Proto-Indo-European tongue. What emerges is a striking philosophical thesis, which very well may lie at the root of the mountain of symbolism we have here endeavored to chart. Bear in mind here, at the close, the apparent ontological linkage between the agrarian Saturn, and the magical Fascinus. In the main thrust of his essay, Reghini writes:\n\n \n\n“We have seen that the four ages of Greco-Latin antiquity correspond to the four yugas of Hinduism. An analogous correspondence is possible with the name of Saturnus. It does not involve the planet’s name, which in Sanskrit is shani and signifies “low,” being the lowest or most distant planet. Much more important to us is the correspondence with the Sanskrit designation of the golden age. The first of the four yugas happens to have two names, both interesting for our investigation. They are krta-yuga and satya-yuga. Krta-yuga is the perfect age (per-fectum, “made through and through”), from the root kra, “to make or complete,” from which, according to Curtius, the Greek name Kronos for Saturnus derives. Satya-yuga is the “good age,” the “true age.” The adjective satya, “true,” is connected to sat, “being,” and therefore “the real,” “the true.” Satya-yuga is the age of Sat, the age of “Being.” The affinity between satya and the German satyar is evident; Saeter-tag is the day of the true god, just as Donnerstag is the day of the thunder god. The Latin Sate-urnus, the German saeter, and the Etruscan satre must all indicate the true god … and as the Sanskrit suffix -ya joined to sat gives us the name of the golden age, so the Latin suffix -urnus united to Sat gives us the name of the golden Saturnus, king of the golden age.”"

  "content": "May I take you to the shores of a mountain lake? The sky is blue, the water green and everywhere is profound tranquility. The clouds and mountains are mirrored in the lake, the houses, farms and chapels as well. They do not look as if they were fashioned by man, it is as if they came straight from God’s workshop, like the mountains and trees, the clouds and the blue sky. And everything exudes an air of beauty and peace. \n\n \n\nBut what is this? A discordant note in the tranquility. Like an unnecessary screech. Among the locals’ houses, that were not built by them, but by God, stands a villa. The creation of an architect. Whether a good architect or a bad architect, I don’t know. All I know is that the tranquility, peace and beauty have vanished.\n\n \n\nBefore God there are no good or bad architects, in His presence all architects are equal. In the cities, in the presence of Belial, there are subtle nuances, as is the nature of vice. And therefore I ask, why is it that any architect, good or bad, desecrates the lake?\n\n \n\nThe farmer doesn’t. Nor does the engineer who builds a railway along the shore or scores deep furrows in its clear surface with his ship. They go about things in a different way. The farmer marks out the site for his new house in the green meadow and digs out the trenches for the foundations. Then the mason appears. If there is clay in the area there will be a brickwork delivering bricks. If not, then he can use the stone from the shores of the lake. And while the mason is laying brick upon brick, stone upon stone, the carpenter arrives and sets up his tools. His ax rings out merrily. He is making a roof. What kind of roof? A beautiful or ugly one? He has no idea. It’s just a roof. \n\n \n\nAnd then the joiner measures up the doors and windows, and all the other craftsmen come and measure up and go back to their workshops and work. Finally the farmer mixes up a large tub of whitewash and makes the house nice and white. He cleans the brush and puts it away. He’ll need it again next Easter.\n\n \n\nHis intention was to erect a house for himself and his family, or for his animals, and that is what he has done. Just as his neighbor or his great-grandfather did. Just as every animal does when it is guided by instinct. Is the house beautiful? Yes, just as beautiful as a rose or a thistle, as a horse or a cow. \n\n \n\nAnd I repeat my question: why is it that the architect, no matter whether good or bad, desecrates the lake? Like almost all city dwellers, the architect lacks culture. He lacks the sure touch of the farmer, who does possess culture. The city dweller is rootless. \n\n \n\nWhat I call culture is that balance between our physical, mental and spiritual being which alone can guarantee sensible thought and action. \n\n \n\nI intend to give a lecture soon entitled, “Why do the Papuans have a culture and the Germans not?”\n\n \n\nUntil now there has been no period of non-culture in the history of mankind. This was reserved for the urban society of the second half of the nineteenth century. Until then the culture developed in a steady flow. People responded to the demands of the moment and looked neither forward nor back. \n\n \n\nThen the false prophets appeared, saying, “How ugly and joyless are our lives!” And they gathered together everything from all cultures, set it up in museums and said, “See, that is Beauty. You, however, were wallowing in ugliness.”\n\n \n\nSo then there came household goods decorated with columns and cornices, like houses, there came silks and satins. Then, above all, there came ornamentation. And since the craftsman, as a man of modern culture, was incapable of designing ornamentation, schools were set up in which healthy young people were gradually warped until they were capable of it. Just as in China children are put into a vase and fed for years until they burst out in all their monstrous deformity. Like their Chinese counterparts, these deformed mental monstrosities were duly marveled at and had no difficulty earning a living, thanks to their deformity. \n\n \n\nAt that time there was no one to call out, “Stop and think. The path of culture leads away from ornamentation and to unadorned plainness.” The evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornamentation from objects of everyday use. The Papuan covers everything he can lay his hands on with ornament, from his face and body to his bow and canoe. \n\n \n\nBut today tattoos are a sign of degeneracy and only seen on criminals and degenerate aristocrats. For people of culture, in contrast to the Papuans, a face without tattoos is more beautiful than one with tattoos, even if they had been designed by Michelangelo or Kolo Moser. The nineteenth-century person wants not only his face but also his suitcase, his clothes, his household goods and his house protected from these artificially generated Papuans. Gothic art? We are more advanced than the people of that period. The Renaissance? We are more advanced. We have become more sensitive, more refined. We lack the robust nerves necessary to drink out of an ivory tankard with a battle of the Amazons carved on it. Old techniques have vanished? The Lord be praised. We have been given Beethoven’s music of the spheres in exchange. Our temples are no longer painted blue, red, green and white like the Parthenon, we have learned to appreciate the beauty of the bare stone.\n\n \n\nBut, as I said, at that time there was no one around to remind people of this, and the enemies of our culture, those who sang the praises of foreign cultures, had it all their own way. They were, moreover, wrong. They had misunderstood earlier epochs. Since only those objects were kept which, thanks to their pointless ornamentation, were of less practical use and therefore did not wear out, only objects with ornamentation have come down to us. Consequently people assumed that in the past all objects had ornamentation. Also it was easy to use ornamentation to classify objects by age and origin and cataloguing was—amongst other things—one of the most edifying pastimes of those goddamned times. \n\n \n\nAll this was beyond the honest craftsman. On one and the same day he was supposed to make everything that had been made throughout history in all nations and produce new inventions as well. But these things were the expressions of their culture and were produced by the craftsmen in the same way as the farmer builds his house. The craftsman of the present worked in the same way as the craftsman of the past. A contemporary of Goethe was no longer capable of making ornament. Therefore the warped product of the schools was brought in and the craftsman placed under his tutelage. \n\n \n\nThe mason and the master builder were also placed under tutelage. The master builder just built houses and that was called building in the style of his own times. The one who took control was the man who could build in the style of every past age, the man who had lost contact with his own times, the rootless man, the warped man, in a word, the architect.\n\n \n\nBooks meant little to the craftsman. The architect took everything from books. An abundance of works of reference provided everything and anything worth knowing. People have no idea of the way this mass of slick publishing ventures has poisoned our urban culture, the way it has prevented us from remembering who and what we are. It made no difference whether the architect had internalized the forms so that he could draw them from memory or whether he had to have the sourcebook open before him on the table while producing his “artistic creations,” the effect was always the same: an abomination. And there was no end to the abomination. Everyone was desperate to see their things perpetuated in new publications and a large number of architectural periodicals appeared to satisfy the sanity of architects. And so it has remained to the present day.\n\n \n\nThere is another reason why the architect has ousted the craftsman. He has learned draftsmanship, and since that is all he has learnt, he is good at it. The craftsman is not. He has a heavy hand. The plans of the old master builders are clumsy, any student of building can do that better, not to mention the so-called “fluent hand” so keenly sought and handsomely paid by every firm of architects.\n\n \n\nThe architect has reduced the noble art of building to a graphic art. The one who receives the most commissions is not the one who can build the best but the one whose work looks best on paper. There is a world of difference between the two. If we were to arrange the arts in a row starting with the graphic arts, we will see that there are connections from them to painting. From there we can continue through colored sculpture to sculpture proper and from there to architecture. The graphic arts and architecture are polar opposites, at either end of the row. \n\n \n\nThe best draftsman can be a poor architect, the best architect a poor draftsman. Nowadays those entering architecture are expected to show a talent for graphic art. All our new architecture has been created on the drawing board, these drawings being exhibited three-dimensionally, like paintings in waxworks. \n\n \n\nBut for the old master builders the drawing was merely a means of communicating with the craftsmen who carried out the work. Just as a poet has to communicate through writing. However, we are not so totally devoid of culture as to get a boy to take up poetry just because he has a calligraphic hand. \n\n \n\nIt is a well-known fact that any work of art obeys such powerful inner laws that it can only be carried out in that one form. \n\n \n\nA novel that can be made into a good drama is poor both as a novel and a drama. How much more starkly, then, does this come out when we take two different arts, even if there are points of contact between them. A painting that can be represented as a waxworks group is a bad painting. A presentable Tyrolean can be seen at Kastan’s waxworks, but not a sunrise by Monet or an engraving by Whistler. What is really terrible, however, is to see an architectural drawing, which, given the medium, one has to accept as an example of graphic art—and there are genuine graphic artists among architects—carried out in stone, iron and glass. The sign that a building arises from a genuine feel for architecture is that it makes no impression as a two-dimensional representation. If I could erase the most powerful architectural statement, the Pitti Palace, from people’s memory and enter it for a competition, drawn by the best draftsman, the adjudicators would have me put away in a lunatic asylum.\n\n \n\nAs things are then, the “fluent hand” holds sway. Architectural forms are no longer created by the craftsman’s tools, but by the pencil. From the elevation of a building, from the manner of a piece ornamentation, one can tell whether the architect was using a no. 1 or a no. 5 pencil. And what terrible havoc the compass as wreaked on our taste! Since architects have taken up the ruling pen, architectural drawings have come out in a rash of little squares and no window embrasure, no marble slab is uninfected. The tiniest details are drawn in on a scale of 1:100 and the bricklayer and stonemason have to chip out or build up the graphic nonsense by the sweat of their brow. If the draftsman happens to have colored ink in his pen, then the gilder has to be called in. \n\n \n\nBut I repeat: a true building makes no impression as a picture, reduced to two dimensions. It is my greatest pride that the interiors I have created are completely lacking in effect when photographed; that the people who live in them do not recognize their own apartments from the photographs, just as the owners of a Monet would not recognize it at Kastan’s waxworks. The honor of seeing my works published in the various architectural journals is something I have had to do without. I am denied the satisfaction of my vanity.\n\n \n\nDoes this perhaps mean I am working in a vacuum? Nothing of mine is known. But this is where the power of my ideas an the rightness of my teachings become apparent. I, the unpublished architect, I, the man working in a vacuum, am the only one among thousands who has had real influence. I can give an example. When I finally had the chance to create an interior—it was hard enough since, as I have said, my kind of work cannot be represented graphically—the response was very hostile. That was twelve years ago when I did the Cafe Museum in Vienna. The architects called it “Cafe Anarchism.” But my Cafe Museum still stands today while all the modern joinery of thousands of others has long since been consigned to the junk room. Or they are ashamed of it. That the Cafe Museum has had more influence on modern joinery work than all previous projects put together can be proved by a quick glance at the 1899 volume of the Munich Journal, Dekorative Kunst, where this interior was reproduced, presumably due to a mistake made by the editor. But these two photographic illustrations had no influence; at the time they were completely ignored. Thus, as you can see, it is only the power of the example that has influence. It was by this power that the influence of the old craftsmen spread more rapidly to the most distant corners of the earth despite or, rather, because of the fact that there was no postal service, no telegraph or newspapers. \n\n \n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century was filled with the sound of false prophets, men without culture, crying, “We have no architectural style!” How wrong, how incorrect. That was the very time that had a more distinct style, one that differed more distinctly from the preceding period, a change unparalleled in cultural history. Since, however, these false prophets could only recognize a product by the varying ornamentation, this ornamentation became a fetish for them and they substituted it for the real thing, calling it “style.” Style was already had, but no ornamentation. If I were to chip off all the ornamentation from our old and new buildings, leaving only the bare walls, I would certainly find it difficult to distinguish fifteenth-century from seventeenth-century buildings. But even the man in the street would recognize those of the nineteenth century at a glance. We had no ornamentation and they moaned that we had no style. So they kept on copying ornaments from the past until even they found it ridiculous, so when they had gone as far as they could go in that direction, they started inventing new ornaments. That is, they had sunk to such a low culture level that they were able to do that. And now they congratulate themselves on having created the style of the twentieth century.\n\n \n\nBut that is not the style of the twentieth century. There are many objects which show the style of the twentieth century in its pure form, and these are objects produced by craftsmen who were not working under the tutelage of one of the warped graduates of the schools. First and foremost they are the tailors, they are the shoemakers, the makers of bags and saddles, carriages and instruments and all those who avoided the fate of being uprooted from our culture because their craft seemed too ordinary to the false prophets to be worth reforming. What good fortune! From such scraps as the architects left me I was able, twelve years ago, to reconstruct modern joinery work, the joinery we would have if architects had never stuck their noses in a joiner’s workshop. I did not approach the task like an artist, giving free rein to his creative imagination (as they doubtless put it in artistic circles). No. I went to the workshops, as timid as an apprentice, looked up respectfully to the man in the blue apron, and asked him to share his secrets with me. For many a piece of workshop tradition still lay there, bashfully hidden from the eyes of the architects. And when they realized what I wanted, when they saw I was not one of those who would deface their beloved wood with his drawing-board fantasies, when they saw that I had no intention of defiling the noble color of their revered material with green or violet stains, they glowed with craftsman’s pride, revealed their carefully concealed tradition and gave vent to their hatred of their oppressors. I found modern paneling in the cladding of old lavatory water tanks, I found a modern solution for the problem of corners in the chests for silver cutlery, I found locks and metal fittings on suitcases and pianos. And I found out the most important thing, namely that the style of 1900 only differs from the style of 1800 to the exact same extent as the tailcoat of 1900 differs to that of 1800. \n\n \n\nBy not very much, that is. The one was made of blue cloth and had gold buttons, and the other is of black cloth and has black buttons. The black coat is in the style of our times, that no one can deny. In their arrogance the warped graduates of the schools had not bothered to reform our clothing. They were all serious-minded and felt it beneath their dignity to waste their time on such things. That is why our clothing has remained in the style of our times. The invention of ornament was the only activity deemed worthy of such dignified, serious-minded men.\n\n \n\nWhen I finally received a commission for a building, I said to myself, “In its external appearance a building can at most have changed as much as a tail coat. By not very much, that is.” And I saw how our ancestors built and I saw how, century by century, year by year, they had freed themselves from ornamentation. So I had to go back to the point where the chain had broken. One thing I did know: in order to continue the line of this development I had to be appreciably simpler. I had to replace the gold buttons with black ones. The building had to look unobtrusive. Had I not once said, modern dress is that which draws the least attention to itself. It sounded paradoxical, but there were good honest people who carefully collected it, like so many of my paradoxical ideas, and put it into print again. It happened so often people eventually accepted it as true. \n\n \n\nBut as far as inconspicuousness was concerned, there was one thing I had not taken into account. What was true of clothing was not true of architecture. If our warped graduates had left architecture in peace and reformed our clothing along the lines of old theater costumes or the Sezession, then presumably the reverse would have been the case. \n\n \n\nJust try to visualize it. Everyone is wearing clothes from some past age or other, or some distant, imaginary future. You see men from the mists of antiquity, women with piled-up hair-styles and farthingales, exquisite gentlemen in Burgundian hose. And among them will be a few roguish moderns in purple pumps and apple-green silk jerkins with appliqué work by Professor Walter Scherbel. And now a man in a plain overcoat appears among them. Would he not arouse attention? Even more, would he not cause offense? And would not the police come, whose job it is to remove anything and anyone that causes a public nuisance?\n\n \n\nIt is the reverse that is the case, however. Our clothes are right, the fancy-dress ball is architecture. My building (the so-called “Loos Building” on Michaelerplatz in Vienna, which was built in the same year as this article was written) really caused offense and the authorities were on the spot in no time at all. That kind of thing was all right in the privacy of someone’s home, but not out in the street.\n\n \n\nSome doubts will have crept in during these last remarks, doubts about the validity of comparing tailoring and architecture. Architecture is an art, after all. I grant you that, for the moment anyway. But have you never noticed the remarkable correspondence between people’s appearance and that of buildings? Does not the Gothic style of with the extravagantly tagged and scalloped dress of the times? The Baroque with the full-bottomed wig? But do our modern buildings go with our dress? People are afraid of uniformity? Were not the old buildings of the same period and the same country uniform? So uniform we can sort them out according to styles and countries, nations and cities. This neurotic vanity, this vain neurosis of having to do things differently from one’s fellow craftsmen at all costs was unknown to the old artisans. Tradition determined the forms. And it was not forms that changed it, but the craftsmen, who found conditions arose under which they could not remain true to the fixed, hallowed, traditional form. New tasks changed the forms and thus the rules were broken, new forms arose. But the people of those times were in harmony with the architecture of their times. The new building that had gone up pleased everyone. Today, however, most buildings only please two people: the architect and his client. \n\n \n\nA building should please everyone, unlike a work of art, which does not have to please anyone. A work of art is a private matter for the artist, a building is not. A work of art is brought into the world without there being a need for it, a building meets a need. A work of art has no responsibility to anyone, a building to everyone. The aim of a work of art is the make us feel uncomfortable, a building is there for our comfort. A work of art is revolutionary, a building conservative. A work of art is concerned with the future and directs us along new paths, a building is concerned with the present. We love anything that adds to our comfort, we have anything that tries to pester us into abandoning our established and secure position. We love buildings and hate art. \n\n \n\nSo the building has nothing to do with art and architecture is not one of the arts. That is so.\n\n \n\nOnly a tiny part of architecture comes under art: monuments. Everything else, everything that serves some practical purpose, should be ejected from the realm of art. \n\n \n\nOnly when we have got rid of the great misunderstanding that art is something that can be harnessed to a practical purpose, only when the fallacious catchphrase “applied art” has disappeared from the vocabulary of all nations, will we have the architecture of our times. The artist has only himself to consider, the architect society as a whole. But combining art and craft has done immeasurable harm to both, and to mankind. We no longer know what art is. In blind fury we persecute the artist and prevent the creation of works of art. Hourly we commit the great sin, the sin that cannot be forgiven, the sin against the Holy Spirit. Murder, robbery, everything can be forgiven. But all those ninth symphonies, the creation of which mankind in its blindness has prevented through its persecution of artists—no, not even that, through its sins of omission—will not be forgiven us. It is thwarting God’s design. \n\n \n\nMankind no longer knows what art is. “Art in the service of commerce” was the title of a recent exhibition in Munich and there was no one to score out the offending words. And no one laughs at that splendid expression “applied art.”\n\n \n\nBut to anyone who knows that art is there to lead mankind on and on, higher and higher, to make us more and more like gods, combining art with a material function is a profanation of the great goddess. People do not leave the artist free to do as he thinks fit because they are not in awe of him, and craftwork cannot develop freely because of the weight of aesthetic expectations we place on it. It is not the business of the artist to have the majority of his contemporaries behind him, his realm is the future. \n\n \n\nSince there are buildings in good and bad taste, people assume the former are designed by artists, the latter by non-artists. But building in good taste should be just as much a matter of course as putting your knife in your mouth or cleaning your teeth in the morning. People are here confusing art and culture. Can you show me one piece of bad taste from past times, that is from a cultured age? The buildings of the least master mason in a provincial town were in good taste. Of course there were great masters and lesser masters. Thanks to their profound knowledge, the great masters were in closer contact with the world spirit than the others. \n\n \n\nArchitecture arouses moods in people, so the task of the architect is to give these moods concrete expression. A room must look cozy, a house comfortable to live in. To secret vice the law courts must seem to make a threatening gesture. A bank must say “Here your money is safe in the hands of honest people.” \n\n \n\nAn architect can only achieve this by going back to those buildings of the past which aroused these moods in people. For the Chinese, white is the color of mourning, for us black. Therefore our architects would find it impossible to create cheerful moods with black paint. \n\n \n\nIf we were to come across a mound in the woods, six foot long by three foot wide, with the soil piled up in a pyramid, a somber mood would come over us and a voice inside us would say, “There is someone buried here.” That is architecture. \n\n \n\nOur culture is founded on the recognition of the all-transcending greatness of classical antiquity. Our manner of thinking and feeling we have adopted from the Romans, who taught us to think socially and discipline our emotions. \n\n \n\nIt is not mere chance that the Romans were incapable of inventing a new order of columns, a new ornament. The Greeks, who invented the moldings, were individualists, scarcely Abel to govern their own cities. The Romans invented social organization and governed the whole world. The Greeks applied their imagination to the elevation, which is individual, the Romans to the ground plan, which is general. The Romans were more advanced than the Greeks, we are more advanced than the Romans. The great masters of architecture believed they built like the Romans. They were mistaken. Period, place, climate frustrated their plans. But whenever lesser architects tried to ignore tradition, whenever ornamentation became rampant, a master would appear to remind us of the Roman origins of our architecture and pick up the thread again. \n\n \n\nThe last great master arose at the beginning of the nineteenth century: Schinkel. We have forgotten him. But the light of this great figure will fall on future generations of architects."

  "title": "The Stone Ring or the Magic Circle",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/stone-ring-magic-circle",
  "content": "The patient labors of archaeologists have brought to light thousands of graves which lie scattered all over South India and the Deccan. They belong to different ages. The earliest of them go back to what is generally called the Stone Age; and the latest belong to the 15th and 16th centuries of the Christian era. They are classified by specialists into a number of types, each of which is sharply distinguished from the others by special peculiarities of construction. The most primitive of them is, perhaps, the simple ring of stones, with three stones in the centre, marking the place where the dead body lies buried. There are hundreds of these stone circles at Amaravati in the Kistna district, and archaeologists are of the opinion that the place marks the site of the burial ground of some ancient city, probably that of Dharanikota, the eastern capital of the Andhra kings of the Satavahana dynasty. This is very probable, as stone circles are still made use-of by certain savage tribes to mark their place of burial. The Todas of the Nilgiri Hills, “even now burn their dead in a circle of stones, and bury the ashes there [1].” Generally, they do not construct a new circle of stones for every corpse that is cremated; but they make use of “the same circle for repeated cremation. [2]” The circle of stones that is put to this use is called by Todas an “azaram;” and the Toda practice of constructing azarams gives us some idea regarding the nature of the circles at Amaravati.\n\n \n\nWe have to start our inquiry with the cemetery of Dharanikota, the ancient capital of the Andhras. Why did the people of this old city build stone circles around the graves of their dead? Were they required to serve any real purpose? Had they any religious or other significance? What was the meaning of the three stones in the centre? It is necessary that we must find answers to all these questions, if we desire to understand them properly. To begin with, we must ascertain the meaning of the three stones in the middle of the circle. Why three stones are found where one would have been sufficient is certainly a mystery, which cannot be easily unravelled. It is, however, probable that the practice of placing three stones on the graves had a simple origin. They must have been placed to prevent the ghost of the dead man rising from the grave. The stones were originally placed apart, not together, one on the head, another on the abdomen, and a third on the legs. This practice is still observed by the Boyas, a Telugu tribe of hunters living in the hilly tracts on the western border of the Telugu districts [3]. The three stones seem to have been brought together, after the introduction of cremation. Following the Aryan practice, the Dravidians cremated the dead body, and buried the ashes; and the three stones which were originally placed in three different places on the grave were brought together, and deposited over the jar containing the ashes. \n\n \n\nThere appears to have grown up, at the same time, a belief in the minds of the men that the ghost of the dead man lives in the stones. The Khasis, a savage people that live on our Eastern frontier, are accustomed to set up monoliths to honor their dead. A group of three or five, or nine is set up for every dead man whose spirit is supposed to live in it; three, however, is the most common number. The village deities who are closely related to the spirits of the dead, are similarly represented. Pota-Razu, the brother and sometimes the husband of Poleramma, is represented by three pyramidal or conical stones. Mariyatta is represented by three bricks in several places in the City of Madras. Three bricks represent her in Sembudas Street, just behind the University Students’ Club. There is also a tiny shrine of the goddess built of earth behind the three bricks. Another group of three represents her in the Spur Tank; a third group of seven represents the deity under a tree on the Pantheon Road between the Maternity Hospital and the Museum. Another group of three bricks seen in a small shrine in the compound of the Office of the Director of the Public Instruction probably represents Munisvara and not Mariyatta. In all these cases a single spirit or deity is represented by three or more stones. The number of stones does not appear to produce any disintegrating effect upon the spirit or deity. Therefore we cannot be far from the truth, when we say that the three stones in the midst of the circle at Amaravati represent the spirit of the dead man.\n\n \n\nThe circle of stones surrounding the three stones, or more generally the cairn, has attracted much attention. Two or three theories which propose to explain its meaning have already been started. Mr. Longhurst is of the opinion that the stone circles appear to be only intended as retaining walls for the earth and stones which were heaped over the stone sepulcher in the middle [4]. Mr. Longhurst’s theory has an exclusive reference to the circle surrounding cairns. He ignores completely the simple stone circles, such as those that are found at Amaravati. Moreover, his theory fails to give a satisfactory explanation even of those circles that surround cairns. Their presence in places where they are not at all required to perform the functions of ‘retaining walls’ destroys the theory altogether. Another hypothesis is suggested by Mr. William Crooke in his book Things Indian. He says, “The circle was probably intended as a ‘ghost-hedge,’ to restrain the spirit within these assigned limits, or a sign that the site was taboo [5].” This appears to be true. The burial-ground is generally regarded as an impure place. Anyone who enters it is polluted, and he requires to be purified. What is true of the burial ground is equally true of individual graves. We find it recorded in the Rig Veda that the Aryans considered the burial-ground as taboo. R.-V. X. 18 says:—\n\n \n\nI place this barrier [of stones]  on this\n\naccount that no one may go beyond it.\n\n \n\nMore generally, however, primitive people are afraid of the spirits of the dead. It is a common belief among them that the ghosts of the dead are unhappy, and that they wreak vengeance upon the living, if they neglect them after death. They are also said to be the causes of epidemics and famines. It is, therefore, necessary to propitiate them, and buy them off, by means of gifts. \n\n \n\nThe Birhors of Central India are very much troubled by the fear of evil spirits. It is said that as soon as a Birhor is dead, “his disembodied spirit becomes the prime object of fears and concern to his relatives and other people of his settlement. And the observances and ceremonies customary during this period appear to have for their main object, the prevention of harm to the tanda though his spirit on the one hand, and on the other hand of harm to his spirit through stray, malignant spirits. Even the offering of food laid out for the spirit appears to be promoted less be a feeling of affection for him than from fear and a desire to keep him agreeably engaged at a distance.” \n\n \n\nAgain, “the spirit of the deceased hovers about in an unsettled state between the land of the living on the one side, and the spirit world on the other, and is considered peculiarly dangerous to the community as well as to itself. A woman dying within twenty-one days of childbirth, or a child dying within twenty-one days of birth, may never be admitted into the community of ancestor-spirits, as their spirits are always dangerous. In their case, therefore, a new doorway to the hut is opened to take their corpse to the grave. These corpses are buried in a place apart from that where the other corpses are buried. Women and not men bury such corpses; the men only dig the graves and go away. Thorns are pricked into their feet to prevent them from leaving their graves [6].” \n\n \n\nThe Mundas of Chota Nagpur worship a set of spirits called “bonita bongas.” They consider it necessary to propitiate these spirits. The bonita bongas “are indeed no gods at all, nor are they regarded by the Mundas as such. These malevolent entities … are believed to be earth-bound spirits of persons who died a violent and unnatural death. The propitiation of this class of spirits is the duty—not of the Munda householder, nor of the Munda village priest, Pahan—but of the ghost-finders … Occasionally, indeed, the earth-bound spirit of some deceased member of a family haunts his old fields and may do some mischief, and has in such a case to be propitiated by sacrifices … [7]”\n\n \n\nIt is interesting to note that the Mundas who are closely related to Birhors, are in the habit of erecting rough cromlechs over the graves of their dead.\n\n \n\n“A grave is dug at a selected spot in the Sasan (smasana), and in it the earthen vessel containing the bones of the deceased is interred. Along with the bones, a little rice, oil mixed with turmeric and a few copper coins (pice) are put into a vessel. After the excavation is filled up, the large stone slab is placed upon it, supported on four small pieces stone at the four corners [7].”\n\n \n\nThe connection between the simple circle of stones and the cromlech is well known. The latter was developed from the former, after a long process of evolution in the art of building tombs.\n\n \n\nIt is from such beliefs as have been described above that the extensive practice of worshiping the spirits of the dead arose. The true religion of the masses in South India is based upon the fear of demons with which their minds are filled. It is this fear that induced the ancient inhabitants of the land to take many precautionary steps to restrain their malignant activity. One of the steps which they adopted is to circumscribe their sphere of activity by erecting a magic circle of stones around the grave. The stone circles which form a striking feature of prehistoric graves had their origin in the need which the primitive people felt to prevent the ghosts from wandering far from the graves. \n\n \n\nThe meaning of the stone circles at Amaravati has been made clear by what has been said above; but these circles were not a peculiar feature of Andhra social customs in a bygone age. They are still erected in the Deccan and Western India in a modified form. The inhabitants of these parts are not in the habit of erecting stone circles around the graves of the dead; but they build them in order to honor the demon, Vetal or Bhetala whom they commonly worship. Vetal is at present regarded as an avatara of Siva; but if we carefully examine his past career, the fact that he was originally a demon becomes clear. The cult of this demon is said to be very ancient. Two arguments are generally advanced to prove its antiquity. In the first place, “Vetal in Deccan has no image in the shape of any animal whatever, It seems then possible that his worship was introduced previous to the custom of likening gods to men and other animals.” Secondly, “Vetal has no temple, but is worshiped in the open air, generally under the shade of a wide-spreading tree. This circumstance also connects his worship with the most ancient forms of idolatry [8].”\n\n \n\nDr. Stevenson gives us the following description of the shrine of Vetala: “This place where Vetal is worshiped is a kind of stone-henge or inclosure of stones, usually in somewhat of a circular shape. The following is the plan after which these circles are constructed. At some distance from the village, under a green spreading tree of any common indigenous species is placed Vetal. If as sometimes happens in a bare country like the Dekhan, no tree at a convenient distance is to be found, Vetal is content to raise his head under a canopy of heaven without the slightest artificial covering whatever. The principal figure where the worship of Vetal is performed is a rough unhewn stone, of a pyramidal or a triangular shape placed on its base, having one of its sides fronting the east, and if under a tree, placed to the east side of the tree. The stone is of various dimensions [9].” William Crooke also gives a similar account of the circles of Vetala: “In Deccan we find numerous stone circles erected in honor of Vetala, the ghost-king or the demon-lord. They are in form analogous to the European monuments of this class. The centre is occupied by a large stone in which the demon lives, and the surrounding ring his followers [10].”\n\n \n\nThe passages that have been cited above show that there is a marked resemblance between the Vetala circles, and the circles at the cemetery in the neighborhood of Amaravati. In both cases, there is a circle of stones surrounding a stone or group of three stones. We shall now proceed to examine Vetala circles further, to see whether the resemblance between them and the circles at Amaravati is only superficial, or whether there is any tie of kinship which really unites them together. The nature of Vetala and the rites connected with his worship are vividly described in the Katha-sarit-sagara, a sixth century translation into Sanskrit of the Brihatkatha of Gunadhya, who is supposed to have lived between the 1st century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. We understand from this work that the term Vetala did not originally signify an individual demon but a class. It was applied to the ghosts of a particular type. They dwelt in the cemeteries and lived upon the corpses. They could assume the forms of men or animals at will. We have a quaint description of Vetala in one place: “Then came a Vetala, as tall as a black palmyra tree, with the neck of a camel, the face of an elephant, the feet of a buffalo, the eyes of an owl, and the ears of a donkey [11].” But more frequently, the Vetalas were believed to be ordinary ghosts which animated dead bodies. They could be pressed into the service of men, by means of powerful charms. There grew up a desire in men’s minds to master them by uttering mantras. This desire gave birth to an extensive practice of sorcery. A person delirious of subjugating a Vetala was required to perform certain preliminary rites, which were usually conducted in the smasana on the night of the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight. The undertaking was, indeed, risky, for the demon was in the habit of playing many pranks to deceive the sorcerer. If he were not courageous, he would be eaten by the demon. Many sorcerers, therefore, sought and obtained the help of heroes, in order to secure their subject. \n\n \n\nThe rites that were performed in connection with the worship of Vetala are described in the story of Sri-Darsana:\n\n \n\n“The sorcerer adorned the corpse with red garlands and red sandal-paste; he then drew a big circle with the powder of human bones; placed in the four corners, four pots filled with human blood; lighted a lamp with oil extracted from human fat; and making the corpse animated by Vetala lie on its back in the center of the circle, he seated himself upon its chest, and began to perform homa in its mouth, using human bones as fuel.”\n\n \n\nAnother description of this rite is found in one of the stories of Vetala:\n\n \n\n“He (the sorcerer) besmeared the ground with blood, and described thereon a circle with the white powder of pounded human bones; placed at the corners pots filled with blood; lighted a lamp with the oil of human fat; and by the side of it performed homa in the fire.”\n\n \n\nIn another story of the same series we have a further description of this rite:\n\n \n\n“He (the sorcerer) helped the king to deposit the corpse on the ground. Then he gave it a bath, applied sandal paste to it, adorned it with garlands, and established it in the middle of a circle. He besmeared his body with ashes, put on a sacrificial cord of twisted hair, covered himself with a winding sheet, and meditating for a moment, he summoned by the power of his charms a Vetala into the corpse, and worshiped him in accordance with the regulations. The sramana gave Vetala arghya with human blood in a human skull; offered him flowers and perfumes; gave dhupa with human eyes; and offered him human flesh as a solemn meal [14].”\n\n \n\nYet another description:—\n\n \n\n“Having been thus dragged by the force of his mantras I entered the smasana, which was full of bones and skulls, surrounded by bhatas, and resounding with the din caused by the cries of bhairavas, in a frightened condition. There I saw the Kapalika who laid a corpse on its back in the middle of a circle, performing the homa in the fire [15].”\n\n \n\nIn all these descriptions, two important points are noticeable: the circle of pounded human bones: and the position, in its centre, of the corpse to animate into which the Vetala was summoned. The circle is the most primitive and fundamental idea. It “acts as a prison house from which escape is impossible [16].” The ghosts of the dead are kept within this circle.\n\n \n\nThe purpose for which so many stone circles were built in the ancient cemetery in the neighborhood of Amaravati has now been made clear. They were intended to restrain the ghosts from moving far from their graves. The idea that the ghosts could be pressed into the service of man came later. It was then that the sorcerers attempted to summon these ghosts into dead bodies and imprison them in a magic circle, until they promised them obedience. Vetala was not the only demon that became the object of the sorcerer’s magic. The Yakshas were similarly summoned to serve the masters of powerful incantations. But Vetala was the most powerful and cruel of all the demons. This explains his great popularity with the magicians.\n\n \n\nThe cult of Vetala, however, has undergone some modifications, since the days of Gunadhya. What was originally a class name became the name of an individual demon, who is considered at the present day an avatara of Siva. The circle of pounded human bones gave place to the modern circle of stones; and the corpse disappeared to make room for the pyramidal or triangular stone in which the demon is supposed to live. The worship of an amorphous class of demons crystallized into the cult of a single devil. What was originally a temporary shrine took the shape, in the course of time, of a solid and permanent circle of stones."

  "content": "There is, however, another reason why Apollonius is of importance to us. He was an enthusiastic admirer of the wisdom of India. Here again a subject of wide interest opens up. What influences, if any, had Brāhmanism and Buddhism on Western thought in these early years? It is strongly asserted by some that they had great influence; it is as strongly denied by others that they had any influence at all. It is, therefore, apparent that there is no really indisputable evidence on the subject.\n\n​\n\nJust as some would ascribe the constitution of the Essene and Therapeut communities to Pythagorean influence, so others would ascribe their origin to Buddhist propaganda; and not only would they trace this influence in the Essene tenets and practices, but they would even refer the general teaching of the Christ to a Buddhist source in a Jewish monotheistic setting. Not only so, but some would have it that two centuries before the direct general contact of Greece with India, brought about by the conquests of Alexander, India through Pythagoras strongly and lastingly influenced all subsequent Greek thought.\n\n​\n\nThe question can certainly not be settled by hasty affirmation or denial; it requires not only a wise knowledge of general history and a minute study of scattered and imperfect indications of thought and practice, but also a fine appreciation of the correct value of indirect evidence, for of direct testimony there is none of a really decisive nature. To such high qualifications we can make no pretension, and our highest ambition is simply to give a few very general indications of the nature of the subject.\n\n​\n\nIt is plainly asserted by the ancient Greeks that Pythagoras went to India, but as the statement is made by Neo-Pythagorean and Neo-Platonic writers subsequent to the time of Apollonius, it is objected that the travels of the Tyanean suggested not only this item in the biography of the great Samian but several others, or even that Apollonius himself in his Life of Pythagoras was father of the rumour. The close resemblance, however, between many of the features of Pythagorean discipline and doctrine and Indo-Aryan thought and practice, make us hesitate entirely to reject the possibility of Pythagoras having visited ancient Āryāvarta.\n\n​\n\nAnd even if we cannot go so far as to entertain the possibility of direct personal contact, there has to be taken into consideration the fact that Pherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, may have been acquainted with some of the main ideas of Vaidic lore. Pherecydes taught at Ephesus, but was himself most probably a Persian, and it is quite credible that a learned Asiatic, teaching a mystic philosophy and basing his doctrine upon the idea of rebirth, may have had some indirect, if not direct, knowledge of Indo-Aryan thought.\n\n​\n\nPersia must have been even at this time in close contact with India, for about the date of the death of Pythagoras, in the reign of Dareius, son of Hystaspes, at the end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth century before our era, we hear of the expedition of the Persian general Scylax down the Indus, and learn from Herodotus that in this reign India (that is the Punjāb) formed the twentieth satrapy of the Persian monarchy. Moreover, Indian troops were among the hosts of Xerxes; they invaded Thessaly and fought at Platęa.\n\n​\n\nFrom the time of Alexander onwards there was direct and constant contact between Āryāvarta and the kingdoms of the successors of the world-conqueror, and many Greeks wrote about this land of mystery; but in all that has come down to us we look in vain for anything but the vaguest indications of what the “philosophers” of India systematically thought.\n\n​\n\nThat the Brāhmans would at this time have permitted their sacred books to be read by the Yavanas (Ionians, the general name for Greeks in Indian records) is contrary to all we know of their history. The Yavanas were Mlechchhas, outside the pale of the Ćryas, and all they could glean of the jealously guarded Brahmā-vidyā or theosophy must have depended solely upon outside observation. But the dominant religious activity at this time in India was Buddhist, and it is to this protest against the rigid distinctions of case and race made by Brāhmanical pride, and to the startling novelty of an enthusiastic religious propaganda among all classes and races in India, and outside India to all nations, that we must look for the most direct contact of thought between India and Greece.\n\n​\n\nFor instance, in the middle of the third century B.C., we know from Asoka’s thirteenth edict, that this Buddhist Emperor of India, the Constantine of the East, sent missionaries to Antiochus II of Syria, Ptolemy II of Egypt, Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander II of Epirus. When, in a land of such imperfect records, the evidence on the side of India is so clear and indubitable, all the more extraordinary is it that we have no direct testimony on our side of so great a missionary activity. Although, then, merely because of the absence of all direct information from Greek sources, it is very unsafe to generalize, nevertheless from our general knowledge of the times it is not illegitimate to conclude that no great public stir could have been made by these pioneers of the Dharma in the West. In every probability these Buddhist Bhikshus produced no effect on the rulers or on the people. But was their mission entirely abortive; and did Buddhist missionary enterprise westwards cease with them?\n\n​\n\nThe answer to this question, as it seems to us, is hidden in the obscurity of the religious communities. We cannot, however, go so far as to agree with those who would cut the gordian knot by asserting dogmatically that the ascetic communities in Syria and Egypt were founded by these Buddhist propagandists. Already even in Greece itself were not only Pythagorean but even prior to them Orphic communities, for even on this ground we believe that Pythagoras rather developed what he found already existing, than that he established something entirely new. And if they were found in Greece, much more than is it reasonable to suppose that such communities already existed in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt, whose populations were given far more to religious exercises than the sceptical and laughter-loving Greeks.\n\n​\n\nIt is, however, credible that in such communities, if anywhere, Buddhist propaganda would find an appreciative and attentive audience; but even so it is remarkable that they have left no distinctly direct trace of their influence. Nevertheless, both by the sea way and by the great caravan route there was an ever open line of communication between India and the Empire of the successors of Alexander; and it is even permissible to speculate, that if we could recover a catalogue of the great Alexandrian library, for instance, we should perchance find that in it Indian MSS were to be found among the other rolls and parchments of the scriptures of the nations.\n\n​\n\nIndeed, there are phrases in the oldest treatises of the Trismegistic Hermetic literature which can be so closely paralleled with phrases in the Upanishads and in the Bhagavad Gītā, that one is almost tempted to believe that the writers had some acquaintance with the general contents of these Brāhmanical scriptures. The Trismegistic literature had its genesis in Egypt, and its earliest deposit must be dated at least in the first century A.D., if it cannot even be pushed back earlier. Even more striking is the similarity between the lofty mystic metaphysic of the Gnostic doctor Basilides, who lived at the end of the first and beginning of the second century A.D., and Vedāntic ideas. Moreover, both the Hermetic and the Basilidean schools and their immediate predecessors were devoted to a stern self-discipline and deep philosophical study which would make them welcome eagerly any philosopher or mystic student who might come from the far East.\n\n​\n\nBut even so, we are not of those who by their own self-imposed limitations of possibility are condemned to find some direct physical contact to account for a similarity of ideas or even of phrasing. Granting, for instance, that there is much resemblance between the teachings of the Dharma of the Buddha and of the Gospel of the Christ, and that the same spirit of love and gentleness pervades them both, still there is no necessity to look for the reason of this resemblance to purely physical transmission. And so for other schools and other teachers; like conditions will produce similar phenomena; like effort and like aspiration will produce similar ideas, similar experience, and similar response. And this we believe to be the case in no general way, but that it is all very definitely ordered from within by the servants of the real guardians of things religious in this world.\n\n​\n\nWe are, then, not compelled to lay so much stress on the question of physical transmission, or to be seeking even to find proof of copying. The human mind in its various degrees is much the same in all climes and ages, and its inner experience has a common ground into which seed may be sown, as it is tilled and cleared of weeds. The good seed comes all from the same granary, and those who sow it pay no attention to the man-made outer distinctions of race and creed.\n\n​\n\nHowever difficult, therefore, it may be to prove, from unquestionably historical statements, any direct influence of Indian thought on the conceptions and practices of some of these religious communities and philosophic schools of the Gręco-Roman Empire, and although in any particular case similarity of ideas need not necessarily be assigned to direct physical transmission, nevertheless the highest probability, if not the greatest assurance, remains that even prior to the days of Apollonius there was some private knowledge in Greece of the general ideas of the Vedānta and Dharma; while in the case of Apollonius himself, even if we discount nine-tenths of what is related of him, his one idea seems to have been to spread abroad among the religious brotherhoods and institutions of the Empire some portion of the wisdom which he brought back with him from India.\n\n​\n\nWhen, then, we find at the end of the first and during the first half of the second century, among such mystic associations as the Hermetic and Gnostic schools, ideas which strongly remind us of the theosophy of the Upanishads or the reasoned ethics of the Suttas, we have always to take into consideration not only the high probability of Apollonius having visited such schools, but also the possibility of his having discoursed at length therein on the Indian wisdom. Not only so, but the memory of his influence may have lingered for long in such circles, for do we not find Plotinus, the coryphęus of Neo-Platonism, as it is called, so enamoured with what he had heard of the wisdom of India at Alexandria, that in 242 he started off with the ill-starred expedition of Gordian to the East in the hope of reaching that land of philosophy? With the failure of the expedition and assassination of the Emperor, however, he had to return, for ever disappointed of his hope.\n\n​\n\nIt is not, however, to be thought that Apollonius set out to make a propaganda of Indian philosophy in the same way that the ordinary missionary sets forth to preach his conception of the Gospel. By no means; Apollonius seems to have endeavoured to help his hearers, whoever they might be, in the way best suited to each of them. He did not begin by telling them that what they believed was utterly false and soul-destroying, and that their eternal welfare depended upon their instantly adopting his own special scheme of salvation; he simply endeavoured to purge and further explain what they already believed and practised. That some strong power supported him in his ceaseless activity, and in his almost world-wide task, is not so difficult of belief; and it is a question of deep interest for those who strive to peer through the mists of appearance, to speculate how that not only a Paul but also an Apollonius was aided and directed in his task from within.\n\n​\n\nThe day, however, has not yet dawned when it will be possible for the general mind in the West to approach the question with such freedom from prejudice, as to bear the thought that, seen from within, not only Paul but also Apollonius may well have been a “disciple of the Lord” in the true sense of the words; and that too although on the surface of things their tasks seem in many ways so dissimilar, and even, to theological preconceptions, entirely antagonistic.\n\n​\n\nFortunately, however, even today there is an ever growing number of thinking people who will not only be shocked by such a belief, but who will receive it with joy as the herald of the dawning of a true sun of righteousness, which will do more to illumine the manifold ways of the religion of our common humanity than all the self-righteousness of any particular body of exclusive religionists.\n\n​\n\nIt is, then, in this atmosphere of charity and tolerance that we would ask the reader to approach the consideration of Apollonius and his doings, and not only the life and deeds of an Apollonius, but also of all those who have striven to help their fellows the world over."

The tried man knows\nHow stern is sorrow, how distressing a comrade\nFor him who has few of friends and loved ones:\nHe trails the track of the exile; no treasure he has,\nBut heart-chilling frost— no fame upon earth.\nHe recalls his comrades and the costly hall-gifts\nOf his gracious gold-friend, which he gave him in youth\nTo expend as he pleased: his pleasure has vanished!\nHe who lacks for long his lord’s advice,\nHis love and his wisdom, learns full well\nHow sorrow and slumber soothe together\nThe way-worn wanderer to welcome peace.\nHe seems in his sleep to see his lord;\nHe kisses and clasps him, and inclines on his knee\nHis hands and his head as in happier days\nWhen he experienced the pleasure of his prince’s favors.\nFrom his sleep then awakens the sorrowful wanderer;\nHe sees full before him the fallow waves,\nThe sea-birds bathing and beating their wings,\nFrost and snow falling with freezing hail.\nThen heavier grows the grief of his heart,\nSad after his dream; he sorrows anew.\nHis kinsmen’s memory he calls to his mind,\nAnd eagerly greets it; in gladness he sees\nHis valiant comrades.

  "title": "Gift Giving in Middle-earth",
  "url": "https://www.fulmenquarterly.com/gift-giving-middle-earth",
  "content": "I know of no culture which has not arranged some form of peculiar social custom around the giving of a gift. Of course there is the childlike delight in receiving near any gift at all; there is, too, a special joy involved when someone observes a need, which you might not realize you had, and addresses it in the form of a gift. By contrast, some gifts bear grim implications—consider the pit of guilt accompanying  a gift that you feel you should’ve reciprocated, but had nothing to hand. A sense of obligation may arise with a gift (perhaps even by design), which weighs on the recipient. Other gifts can facilitate the jockeying for status and approval, in the form of giving the best gift, or, can intone the cruelty of a calculated barb—which must be accepted gracefully, or else one be thought ungrateful. All of these considerations are timeless, and it’s no surprise that the stricter social hierarchies characteristic of the past only raise the stakes.\n\n \n\nAs it happens, the gift is a special literary device in Middle-earth. It’s a thing with which Tolkien delicately engages in a critique of the Anglo-Saxon custom in the old heroic poetry, for whom the act of gift-giving was elevated perhaps so high as an art. But before we look at Tolkien’s careful handling of those themes in more detail, we ought to examine a few of the historical episodes—which the professor studied so closely himself. First to Beowulf, in which we find that the character of several kings is introduced to the reader specifically by way of their open-handedness.\n\n \n\n[17] The glorious Almighty, made this man renowned.\n\nShield had fathered a famous son:\n\nBeow’s name was known through the north.\n\nAnd a young prince must be prudent like that,\n\nGiving freely while his father lives\n\nSo that afterwards in age when fighting starts\n\nSteadfast companions will stand beside him\n\nAnd hold the line. Behavior that’s admired\n\nIs the path to power among people everywhere.\n\n \n\nIn these lines we find that Hrothgar’s grandfather—the noble King Beow—holds the giving of a gift to be an honorable means to power. In giving, he receives. Even as a prince, he laid the groundwork for his reign by securing the loyalty of his warriors through gifts. In the accounting of Hrothgar’s forebears, there are two things which evidence the fitness of his rule: His prowess on the battlefield, and his willingness to share the prizes. This is a lesson Hrothgar learned well apparently, as when he constructs the ill-fated mead-hall, Heorot, it was described with one purpose in mind:\n\n \n\n[67] So his mind turned\n\nTo hall-building: he handed down orders\n\nFor men to work on a great mead-hall\n\nMeant to be a wonder of the world forever;\n\nIt would be his throne-room and there he would dispense\n\nHis God-given goods to young and old\n\n \n\nThis, as with those of his bloodline—Shield and Beow—is the root of his control over the realm, and as such, forms a bond more out of duty than of selflessness, or care. A king, then, is as duty-bound to offer gifts to his warriors as they are to offer back their service. So it is that a pact is formed with Beowulf, to bring an end to Grendel:\n\n \n\n[375] This man is their son,\n\nHere to follow up an old friendship.\n\nA crew of seamen who sailed for me once\n\nWith a gift-cargo across to Geatland\n\nReturned with marvelous tales about him:\n\nA thane, they declared, with the strength of thirty\n\nIn the grip of each hand. Now Holy God\n\nHas, in His Goodness, guided him here\n\nTo the West-Danes, to defend us from Grendel.\n\nThis is my hope; and for his heroism\n\nI will recompense him with a rich treasure.\n\n \n\nOf course Beowulf, having heard of the plight of the Danes, journeys to Heorot in order to defeat Grendel out of a debt incurred by his father to Hrothgar. The terminology of “recompense” renders the act transactional; further removed from the selfless aspect of gift-giving. According to this picture of the custom, it falls to Beowulf to perform his role in the tradition, and his boast serves in a way to demonstrate both his character and credential.\n\n \n\n[417] To come here to you, King Hrothgar,\n\nBecause all knew of my awesome strength.\n\nThey had seen me boltered in the blood of enemies\n\nWhen I battled and bound five beasts, 420\n\nRaided a troll-nest and in the night-sea\n\nSlaughtered sea-brutes. I have suffered extremes\n\nAnd avenged the Geats (their enemies brought it\n\nUpon themselves, I devastated them).\n\nNow I mean to be a match for Grendel,\n\nSettle the outcome in a single combat.\n\nAnd so, my request, O king of Bright-Danes,\n\nDear prince pf the Shieldings, friend of the people\n\nAnd their ring of defense, my one request\n\nIs that you won’t refuse me, who have come this far,\n\nThe privilege of purifying Heorot.\n\n \n\nSo we understand that Beowulf and Hrothgar both experience the bonds of duty; both must defend their people from the predations of their enemies, embodied in Grendel. Tolkien however, for his part, offers a very particular reading of this chain of events. In his Ofermod—which follows the conclusion to his work on the Battle of Maldon poem—he argues that certain motivations pushed king and hero to exceed their duties. “Beowulf (according to the motives ascribed to him by the student of heroic-chivalric character who wrote the poem about him) does more than he need,” Tolkien observes, “eschewing weapons in order to make his struggle with Grendel a “sporting“ fight: which will enhance his personal glory; though it will put him in unnecessary peril, and weaken his chances of ridding the Danes of an intolerable affliction.”\n\n \n\nWe will return to this point and to the Battle of Maldon in due course, but here it is enough to note that Tolkien takes a position not just about the nobility of what is portrayed, but also about the role of the poet in its portrayal. The pursuit of personal glory at the peril of duty is vice. This is not to say that Beowulf’s actions are not heroic, or even that they should be viewed more negatively, but rather that in counting virtue so too must vice be counted. Especially so in this case, where the nobility of the action itself incurs the peril. For Tolkien, seeking glory rather than seeking the goodness that duty requires, is to imperil that very good. So arrogance threatens the greatest heroes, because they are great and heroic. Of course these themes carry through Tolkien's work, but, for the purposes of this paper we will restrain our scope to the question of gift-giving: How does Tolkien wield this Anglo-Saxon cultural institution in Middle-earth, and how do his characters contend with the perils that caught his attention in Beowulf, and in Beorhtnoth at Maldon?\n\n \n\nFirst, we might compare the historical picture of gift-giving with Tolkien’s cultural milieu in The Lord of the Rings. Where better to start than with the concerns of Hobbits? As perhaps the most humble folk living in Middle-earth, their gift giving practices reflect a culturally pervasive sense of humility. For example, among the Shire-folk Tolkien inverts what is probably the most familiar gift-giving custom: Hobbits give out presents on their birthdays instead of looking to receive them. Naturally it follows that sociable hobbits can expect to receive a gift rather often. On the face of it, the practice lends the halflings a rather cozy air; they seem a childishly whimsical people well-suited to a faerie tale. However, under scrutiny one can see how such a custom fosters a sense of consideration for others, and of the fundamental responsibilities one has to one’s friends. Importantly, as the case is, the only way that the One Ring can change hands without death is in the form of a gift. For Tolkien, the humility of the halflings is what enables them to even conceive of giving such a gift, rather than be content to assure themselves that the Ring is in the best possible hands already. It’s notable that both Gollum and Bilbo rationalize their receipt of the ring as a gift—one they deserved—and Bilbo seems only able to rid himself of it by making it a gift to someone he loves; to Frodo.\n\n \n\nIn contrast to giving selflessly; with a mind to others, Sauron corrupts the bonds of loyalty created by analogy with the gifts of Beow, and his father Shield, called “Ring-Giver” (as were many Anglo-Saxon kings including Hrothgar), into a much more literal force of bondage. Sauron’s ring-gifts of course functioned to turn the Kings of men into his most useful and trusted agents, they fostered a self-interested greed in the dwarves, and even turned the selfless love of the elves for their realms into an imperiled liability. The insidious nature Sauron’s rings is their ability to work on the minds of their recipients in much the same way that vainglory can undermine what good the hero of old might otherwise bring to bear. The rings of Sauron’s art push their bearers toward self-interest and tyranny. They impress the desire to strip the choices from others, toward their own aims. Here again we see two obverse sides to the gift. On the one hand it is a selfless gesture of bonding, but on the other, it becomes a Machiavellian tool of bondage.\n\n \n\nWe understand that the One Ring embodies the subjugation which Sauron would prosecute on Middle-earth. Its influence comes in the form of the subversion of others’ will, and its power to tempt stems from lending the Ring-Bearer the ability to enforce compliance. Because the Ring possesses that authoritarian purity, it can be used to divine the intentions of others purely by their willingness to utilize it; by identifying those willing to accept the “gift”. The One Ring is always rationalized as tribute or gift. Isildur claims it as wergild, the blood price of his fallen father. Gollum, when asked, says the Ring was a birthday gift, though Tolkien tells us that in truth it was stolen from a family member, whom he murdered. Bilbo claims later to have fairly won the Ring despite having stumbled across it and suborned it’s previous possessor. To wield the Ring is to be wielded by it, but beyond, it is fundamentally to accept that the choices of others can, and should be subject to the desires of the Ring-Bearer. For Tolkien this constitutes the elevation of vainglory over duty; raising oneself at the cost of responsibility to others. So it can be seen that the ability to resist the temptations of the Ring over time is closely related with the Ring Bearer’s desire to exert themselves over others. To offer the Ring up, then, is an act which expresses the duality of the gift. Giving the Ring forces a choice on the recipient—with it, Tolkien offers his characters the same peril which he observed in Beowulf and Beorhtnoth alike: Vainglory or duty.\n\n \n\nWe can observe that Frodo uses the Ring several times as a scale, against which to measure his companions, by offering it as a gift. It is a test not of their commitment to the good and wellbeing of others, as this can surely remain well intact even when deeply under the influence of the Ring. Boromir, Denethor and perhaps Saruman at the outset imagined the good they would do with its power, likely tempted by visions similar to those which tempted Galadriel, and Sam when the Ring sought to influence them in their turn. Rather, the Ring-gift is a gauge of the Ring-giver’s belief in the capacity of those around them to strive as they strive, that is, in the giver’s faith that others ought not to be be made to act. So it is that Gandalf, Aragorn, and Galadriel each refuse the gift of the Ring when offered not out of righteousness, but indeed, out of a lack of self-righteousness. Boromir, by contrast, falls to the influence of the Ring for the specific reason that he believed in despair that no other man could save Gondor. This heroic vainglory he confused for his duty to Gondor. Indeed, the moment of his fall is precipitated by his inability to convince the fellowship to travel to Minas Tirith, bringing his desire for the control of others to its peak. Aragorn and Faramir have a great deal in common with Boromir, as champions of Men against the forces of darkness, but, they differ in a few important ways. The most relevant difference is their belief in the willingness of others to preserve the good in the world, just as they do: Of their own accord. Naturally, offering an implement like the One Ring is extremely perilous and not to be done lightly—in gauging a stranger’s character. Frodo only offers the Ring to those he already trusts deeply, or else already suspects to be of noble nature before measuring them in this way.\n\n \n\nBut what do other gifts teach us about Tolkien’s view of Anglo-Saxon values? Indeed there are other instances in which malign power is mitigated by the making of a gift, in the course of the Lord of the Rings. When Tom Bombadil rescues Frodo and his fellows from the barrow wights, it is hardly a coincidence that only by leaving the gold out for passersby to take, can the barrow curse be undone. Other gifts are also magical in nature, either in themselves or in their prescience. The mithril shirt given to Bilbo is an example of just such a mystical material. Most of the gifts bestowed by Galadriel upon the fellowship not only have magical properties, but also exhibit the particular ability to solve a problem still unguessed by its recipient. More than this, however, each of these gifts reveals the particular character of their beneficiary. Bilbo’s mithril shirt represents the high esteem with which the dwarves came to regard him, despite at first having thought poorly of him. There afterward the mithril shirt becomes an elegant symbol of the secret robustness of hobbit-kind, easily hidden when unlooked-for but unbreaking when put to the test.\n\n \n\nFor Galadriel’s gifts, those bestowed upon the fellowship, much has been said by other scholars. And yet, those made to Aragorn and to Gimli however remain of special interest even still. The gift of the Stone of Eärendil had of course been foretold—“Ellesar” he became, on taking up the jewel. Further, in the Unfinished Tales Tolkien tells us that the Stone has healing properties. While this deals directly with the myth of Gondor’s King having “hands of healing,” it further signals Tolkien’s deep understanding of the role of lapidary mysticism in Indo-European healing arts, well into the Christian era. Perhaps most illustrative to the discussion at hand—that is, the role of the gift in revealing one’s character, and forming a binding tie—is Galadriel’s gift to Gimli.\n\n \n\nThere has been much attention drawn in particular to the special honor Galadriel elects to pay Gimli in making a gift of a lock of her hair, given that she long-ago denied this very same request to Fëanor—the creator of Silmarils—three times over. Why, we wonder, was one so noble as Fëanor refused where mere Gimli, then hardly an elf-friend, was indulged? What we find with some reflection on Tolkien’s studies of the Anglo-Saxon epics is that Galadriel’s shift expresses a newly gained humility for both herself, and for Gimli. Recall that at the moment Gimli makes his request, Galadriel has just resisted the temptation to take up the One Ring, to wield it in an attempt to revive her realm. Gimli, for his own part, has just overcome his pride and stubbornness with respect to the elves and has found the willingness to marvel at the beauty of elvenkind. In this exchange, Gimli suddenly requires coaxing to even name his desire, and in his humility, cannot even ask without simultaneously deeming it too great a request to be granted. In Galadriel’s case, she has overcome a certain threat of hubris; an unwillingness to fade, instead embracing the passage of time. In doing so she allows her realm to dwindle rather than resort to the measures that its preservation would require. This capacity differs greatly from the pride and self-regard with which she once refused Fëanor.\n\n \n\nAlthough framing the gift as part of a test of character does have much in common with the Anglo-Saxon practices portrayed in The Battle of Maldon, and in Beowulf, there are a few noteworthy differences required to complete this particular picture of Middle-earth. Returning to Heorot, the formula is rather straightforward. We know that Hrothgar, ring-giver, would make the slayer of Grendel wealthy. Beowulf makes several heroic boasts before Hrothgar, Wealhtheow, Unferth, and all the rest in assembly to witness. He makes a statement of himself, his deeds confirm his boast, and he is rewarded with fame and treasure. This cycle repeats, when Grendel’s mother is slain, and it begins again when he faces the Dragon as king, although he himself is slain. In this case the hero fails his boast, and so leaves the pact of his claims unfulfilled. Is Beowulf any less a hero for this failure, when his works at last fall short of his words? Contemporary Beowulf scholarship would likely suggest that he is not reduced, indeed, he is perhaps enlarged by the grandeur of his demise. Yet dead men win no rings; had he been slain by Grendel there never would have been a poem.\n\n \n\nTo return at last to the Battle at Maldon, we can see another Anglo-Saxon treatment of boast, gift, and tragedy. To briefly summarize, the poem fragment describes the events of the historic battle by someone who according to historians’ consensus was likely a participant. What remains of the poem details the death of Beorthnoth—an Anglo-Saxon lord—at the hands of Viking raiders, and, the resulting deaths of his honored bodyguard. The poem is famous in particular for the boast of Beortnoth, which he makes in reply to the Viking demand for tribute. Instead of subordinating themselves to the invaders Beorhtnoth says they shall receive no gold, only spear tips. However, not all in the battle comport themselves honorably. When Godric fled upon his master’s horse, the Sons of Odda followed—which enticed the throng to flee. Godric in particular is rebuked for having received many horses as gifts from Beorthnoth, and for having boasted of how he would deal with the raiders—that is, his shame revolves around the gift of his horse. It is difficult to imagine that Godric retains any heroic note despite his failure, in this case.\n\n \n\nThe important difference between the gift-giving practice (and its relation to heroism) in the works of Tolkien, and his Anglo-Saxon predecessors is perhaps down to the difference between deed and intent. The gifts in Middle-earth govern intent. Either in the curbing of it (as in the case of the Ring), or in revealing some heroic capacity. The Anglo-Saxon heroes differ in the matter of the boast; those calls to glory which insist that reward is deserved because of the deeds to come. Tolkien’s heroes do not boast, nor do they strive for fame as a method to prove their worth. The gifts in Lord of the Rings do not serve as the pinnacle of exertion and so do not eclipse the nature of the noble undertaking. Beorhtnoth on the other hand, while boasting, allows the Vikings to cross the Panta rather than contesting their crossing. His penalty for this is his utter defeat. Tolkien’s heroes do not imperil their course in order to prove their worthiness, as Beowulf did when he insisted on facing the Dragon alone. This is Tolkien's critique of prior heroic lore. And while he treats the canon with reverence, he nevertheless claims the right of a poet to levy blame on those of little humility. This is a principle perhaps best embodied by Arwen’s gift to Frodo, in recognition of his wounds rather than his service. She intercedes to provide him passage to the Grey Havens—not to be heralded, but to be healed."

  "content": "A Foreword:\n\n \n\nIn the summer of 1955, Tolkien received a letter from the poet W.H. Auden, writing to inform him that Auden had been asked to appear on a broadcast later that fall—to speak on the Lord of the Rings. Being both a friend and an early champion of Tolkien’s work (against a backdrop of rather hostile literary criticism) Auden kindly inquired after any specific points that Tolkien might like him to make on the program. He also asked if Tolkien would supply him a few ‘human touches,’ that is, anecdotes about the process of authoring of the Lord of the Rings. \n\n \n\nNow, Auden had the unfortunate habit of throwing away letters that were sent to him once he’d read them, and so Tolkien’s reply may well have been consigned to the bin—were it not for the fact that a carbon-paper copy of this particular correspondence was kept by Tolkien in his own files.\n\n \n\nNear the end of the professor's response—during the course of which Tolkien recounts some charming ‘discoveries’ that he made in first drafting the story (confessing for example that he was as mystified as Frodo was when Gandalf failed to meet them at the Prancing Pony), we encounter a most interesting bit of information regarding the origin of the Palantíri. Tolkien writes:\n\n \n\n“I knew nothing of the Palantíri, though the moment the Orthanc-stone was cast from the window, I recognized it, and knew the meaning of the ‘rhyme of lore’ that had been running in my mind: seven stars and seven stones and one white tree.”\n\n \n\nAs with any good philologist, a carefully placed word rarely has just the one meaning. That he ‘recognized’ the rock of Orthanc to be one of the seven is to say of course that this particular group of alliterative lines had been with him for some time. The specific significance of the seven stones in the history of Gondor, however, was not revealed until later when it first occurred to Tolkien to write that a curious black stone was flung from the window of Saruman’s high house at the destruction of Isengard.\n\n \n\nBut there is, I think, another reason why Tolkien may have chosen to say that he ‘recognized’ the stone. There is an unmistakable similarity between the wizard Saruman’s divining orb; the holy stone in the mysterious spire, which is the secret source of some knowledge concerning things that are otherwise occluded; and historic traditions of similar divining stones. But then, 'similarity' is a perhaps poorly chosen word. Likeness, maybe, or 'alignment' perhaps would be most appropriate—nearest, that is, to the methodology that Tolkien so carefully observed. Tolkien’s work is not a representation of history, but rather, is in alignment with it. And it is on account of that alignment that the very same scholarly rigor which we afford to the study of the great poetic works of history can be authentically applied to Middle-earth as well, and yield such wonderful fruit. \n\n \n\nIn unfolding the historical context that gave rise to this particular literary thread in Middle-earth, the purpose is not to remove the mystery from Tolkien, but, to point with clarity toward the place where the roots of that mystery really lie. And so one wonders after the full extent the historical milieu in which Tolkien may have recognized his Palantíri, and beyond, if there is something essential in the nature of the Seeing-Stones that can be clarified by regarding them as a reflection of the broader landscape of Indo-European symbolism. This is our task. \n\n \n\nBut first: what exactly does Tolkien say of his stones? A quick survey of what's written in the primary source will serve. With that to guide us we may turn to the Anglo-Saxon materials and then tread backward, in search of the Indo-European spring from which many of Tolkien's mythopoeic devices flow.\n\n \n\n \n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Text\n\n \n\nThe first appearance of a Seeing Stone occurs at the conclusion of Book III in the Two Towers. After Saruman’s voice fails to enchant the company he shrinks away in defeat from the iron balcony, through the shuttered window, and out of sight. Just then, at the precise moment that utter ruin folds around Saruman like a mantle:\n\n \n\n“…a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf’s head, it smote the stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up.”\n\n \n\nThis is the Orthanc-stone, one of the seven Stones of Kings. Of course the very name 'Palantír' is a Quenya compound comprising Tir meaning ‘to watch,’ and Palan, meaning ‘far and wide.’ While they ride for Minas Tirith Gandalf recalls some of the stones’ history to Pippin. He defines the name as ‘that which looks far away.’ \n\n \n\nIn the beginning there were more than seven of these stones, though how many is unknown. They were wrought in Valinor (‘maybe’ by Fëanor himself, Gandalf postulates), far to the west beyond Westernesse in days most ancient, before the first rising of the moon. In truth the Palantíri were precursors to those greater jewels, the Silmarils, for before them, Tolkien tells us that Fëanor crafted “other crystals… wherein things far away could be seen small but clear.” For now however, we’ll set the linkage between the Silmarils and the Palantíri aside. So much for their origins: In the divine lands of the utter west, in the early days of the world, above and beyond the art of Saruman—Gandalf tells us—“and beyond Sauron’s too.” \n\n \n\nStepping a bit forward in the history of the stones (to manage the scope somewhat) we turn our attention to the Fall of Númenor. Tolkien tells us in the final pages of his Unfinished Tales that some number of Palantíri had been made an “inalienable gift” by the elves of Valinor to Elendil’s bloodline, beginning with his father. When Númenor was destroyed, seven of those stones were saved and carried east over the sea. It is unclear whether the seven that survived were indeed all of the stones given to Elendil's line, or, whether some of that number perished in Númenor and only seven were able to be preserved. In either case, Elendil carried three and his two sons Isildur and Anárion carried two each. In passing we might observe that this episode gently calls to mind the rescue of the Penates by Anchises, carried out of the sack of Troy by Aeneas and his son Ascanius. Perhaps a subject for another time.\n\n \n\nElendil and his sons founded two kingdoms of Númenorean heritage in Middle-earth: Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south. His three stones Elendil positioned in Arnor. One at the tower on Amon Sûl or Weathertop toward the Misty Mountains, another at the city of Annúminas north of the lands that would later be called the Shire, and one at the tower of Elostirion, west of the Shire-lands to overlook the sea. His sons placed their four in Gondor: one at Orthanc in the ring of Isengard, one in the white tower of Minas Tirith. Another in the sister tower at Minas Ithil, and the fourth was placed under the Dome of the Stars in Osgiliath, on the river Anduin. This was the initial configuration of the Seeing-Stones as Elendil’s line placed them, establishing both cities and fortifications, we might say, with black stones as their symbolic foundations. \n\n \n\nIn the Unfinished Tales Tolkien also provides us with a detailed description of the Palantíri's function in scrying. We learn that each stone has two poles, which must be aligned to the poles of the earth in order to sit \"upright.\" Properly oriented, the stones function like lenses through which a skilled scryer can peer in order to gain sight over a remote location. To look into the west, he explains, one must stand on the opposite side of the stone and peer through it into the west, like a lens, and so on. \n\n \n\nFor our purposes, we ought to step back a moment and summarize the critical qualities of the Palantíri: Their origins lie in a mystical land, long ago and far away deep in the west. This was the land where the celestial beings of creation made their home in the earthly realm. The stones were carried to Middle-earth oversea, gifts from the elvish race of forerunners, and became symbols of the royal lineage of men. The stones were viewed as the birthright of the Kings, of the house of Elendil—as Gandalf named them: \"The Stones of Kings.\" They were initially positioned in a foundational capacity in building the kingdoms of men. Perfectly spherical, black in color \"like glass\" or \"crystal,\" and possessed of an inner fire, the stones could be used to divine special knowledge through scrying; through esoteric vision or sight. Each exhibited a microcosmic quality, according to its form (\"globes,\" Tolkien called them) and, according to the proper alignment of its poles with those of earth. \n\n \n\nOf course we know Tolkien's Palantíri are, on the face, something of an early-modern picture of divination; the magician gazing into his crystal ball. And we understand, as Tom Shippey carefully detailed in the final pages of The Road to Middle Earth, that the Palantíri serve to make a point about the perils of speculation, there in the text. But by digging much further into the Anglo-Saxon and Germanic ideas surrounding precious stones, and their eventual uses for diviners, and through revealing a linkage between those ideas, coronation rituals, and foundation rituals, it will become clear that the Palantíri exhibit a far more complex relationship to historical traditions than Tolkien scholars may yet have recognized.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nThe Crystal Ball in Antiquity\n\n \n\nHow interesting it was to discover that the publisher of both the Hobbit, and the Lord of the Rings—Allen & Unwin—also published Audrey L. Meaney’s review of Anglo-Saxon grave sites in 1964. Of specific interest in her gazetteer are the inclusions of small spheres of quartz crystal (and other precious stones) with funerary deposits—usually in the graves of women. Many examples have been discovered, and hang now among the jewelry exhibits and the funerary exhibits in museums across England. By 1981, Meaney produced a more in-depth survey of funerary rites, but also of amulets, charms, and the healing practices of the Anglo-Saxons. Wondering after the history and origins of the crystal ball as we know it today, to compare to the works of Tolkien, there's hardly a better place to begin. After all, it's very unlikely that analogous artifacts like the Kingmoor Ring with its apotropaic inscription were somehow unknown to the professor.\n\n \n\nIt is typical to find that grave deposits were associated with the body in terms of the object’s use. For example, a bronze ring found near the finger bones, a brooch unearthed lying near the collar bone, a necklace at the throat. The crystal ball of the Anglo-Saxons was of a size appropriate to rest within the palm of the hand. It was usually set into a pair of metal bands and fitted with a loop at the top, in order that it could be hung from a chain or cord. Curiously, its canonical position in the grave is below the waist in the area of the knees. Scholarly consensus holds that such positioning is an indication that these objects were worn hanging like pendants from the belt. That is all well and good.\n\n \n\nThe oldest crystal balls discovered in England date to the late 5th century, commensurate with the expansion of Germanic-speaking settlement in England from the mainland. We find, as well, similar crystal balls in Germanic graves behind on the continent—also positioned between the knees. These continental amulets are distributed along the Rhine, around the Upper Danube, and even as far as France, suggesting both that the tradition of their use was widespread, and further, that they were brought over to England very early on by the Anglo-Saxons in accordance with a well established practice. \n\n \n\nSome four hundred years prior, in the first century AD, similar crystal ball amulets begin to appear in Sarmatia, in Hungary. The very oldest crystal balls of this particular type yet identified were unearthed in Greco-Scythian graves dated to the third and fourth century BC; some eight hundred years before the Anglo-Saxons first carried them to England. So we can begin to understand just by taking stock of the archaeological record that there was apparently a set of deeply related traditions, which made use of strikingly similar crystal ball amulets all across the Germanic world. Moreover, those traditions seem to have been inherited by the Germanics from an earlier source. \n\n \n\nSeveral questions begin to weigh on us at this point: what essential significance was afforded to the crystal ball, such that it was so widely known? What was it used for, and how was it used? In order to answer these questions, several far-reaching trains of thought will have to proceed more or less in-tandem. First, that the ancients held the nature of precious stones to be fundamentally tied to the element of water. Second, that water—on account of symbolic associations with light, and thereby with translucence and reflectivity—has long been among the principle vehicles for divination. And third, owing to a certain affinity for the sun exhibited by no other stones than gemstones, that the gemstone was believed in one way or another to confer a warming, curative effect to the body. We will examine all three together, and see then what can be learned about the heritage of Tolkien's Seeing Stones at last.\n\n \n\nIn the fourth century AD a curious poem appears, written in Greek, called the Orphic Lithica. The most recent English edition of this work (at the time of writing) is a lyrical translation conducted by Charles William King in 1880. The poem details many precious stones and their uses both medicinally and ritualistically—among them, of course, is the crystal. We learn here that the crystal was used in a kind of liturgical fashion; that the gods would be more likely to acquiesce the prayers of those who held crystal balls in-hand. We learn too that the crystal was taken to bear a strong likeness to the sun on account of its special ability to conjure fire from daylight, when clear and therefore ‘most virtuous.’ Next we are told that the crystal—despite its sympathetic bond to the sun and ability to produce flame—remains icy-cold to the touch even if plucked directly from the fire. This quality is perhaps best understood in the sense that the crystal, if used like a lens to focus sunlight and kindle a flame, never itself heats up to such a degree; throughout the process it can be handled and can thus plucked, 'cold, from the fire.' And finally, Orpheus tells us that the stone has its medical uses, particularly for allaying sickness of the liver. In the Lithica, then, we can already see all three trains of thought well-formed. There is the particular in-dwelling fire, a magical icy or watery quality, and, a curative, healing function.\n\n \n\nRecall that by the time the Orphic Lithica is authored, crystal ball amulets have been present in Germanic graves all across Northern Europe for at least three hundred years, and will travel to England with the Anglo-Saxons in only a few decades. We will reproduce the entire relevant section here, beginning at line 170:\n\n \n\nTake in the pious hand the Crystal bright\n\nTransparent image of the Eternal Light, \n\nPleased with its lustre, every god shall hear\n\nThy vows with favour and concede thy prayer.\n\nBut how to test the virtue of the stone, \n\nA certain way I will to thee make known:\n\nWithout fire’s aid to raise the flame divine,\n\nThis wondrous gem lay on thou splintered pine;\n\nForthwith, reflecting the bright orb of day,\n\nUpon the wood it shoots a slender ray,\n\nCaught by the unctuous fuel this shall raise\n\nFirst smoke, then sparks, and last a mighty blaze.\n\nSuch we the fire of ancient Vesta name,\n\nLoved by the immortal all, a holy flame;\n\nNo fire terrestrial with such grateful fumes,\n\nThe fatted victim on their hearth consumes.\n\nYet though of fire the source, strange to be told,\n\nSnatch from the flame the stone—’tis icy cold!\n\nGirt round his loins with this, the sufferer gains\n\nA sure relief from nephritic pains.\n\n \n\nThree hundred years before this poem was authored, we can find some of these same themes in Rome—most prominently the likeness between crystal and ice—which indicates that such ideas were, even in those days, likely matters of diffuse and common knowledge. Perhaps the author of the Lithica was referencing Roman writers directly. In book 37 of his Natural History, Pliny writes: “Crystal is only to be found in places where the winter snow freezes with the greatest intensity.” He goes on to propose that the root of the Ancient Greek word 'κρύσταλλος' (krustallos), from kruos, or “cold,” alludes to this fact. For our purposes Pliny affirms that the watery quality of crystal was not a Roman invention, but rather, was held in some degree to have been learned from the Greeks. Prior, in book 36 when discussing the formation of specular stones Pliny likewise includes the following aside: “It would appear that this substance is originally a liquid, which, by an animating power in the earth, becomes congealed like crystal…” \n\n \n\nHe goes on to make several points, among which is that crystal was esteemed in particular by ladies—a curious conjunction with their later disposition in the graves of Germanic women. He observes too that crystal bears a striking resemblance to a certain set of stones called ceraunia, or ‘thunderstones.’ Without delving too far into the particulars, it’s worth noting that a thunderstone is a fixture of many Indo-European lapidary traditions. They were believed to have been formed either by lightning striking the earth, or, to have fallen from the heavens with the strike of lightning. Recall the way in which Tolkien chose to reveal the rock of Orthanc—falling unexplained from the sky. According to some folk customs which hold that lightning never strikes the same place twice, ceraunaie were often present in various apotropaic contexts—architectural, talismanic, and so on. \n\n \n\nA final comment as it pertains to Pliny’s treatment; there a contemporary treatise by Dioscorides (De Materia Medica) in which he adds to Pliny’s picture that the special hardening process which is imagined to render crystal from ice, is facilitated by the activity of the rays of the sun. And so again, between Pliny and Dioscrorides we see all three trains of thought. The triad of crystal-water-sun will emerge much later as a fixture of Medieval literature, with the solar component linked to the body.\n\n \n\nContinuing for the moment with our consideration of the crystal ball in a Roman context, we will suddenly have to step forward quite a bit to find a commentary on Livy, dated 1617, by de Vignere. This work contains a list of artifacts allegedly discovered in a Roman urn, and included in the list are two crystal balls; \"deux pommes des crystall, une autre moindre.\" Similarly, a 1729 treatise by a Montfaucon describes twenty crystal balls discovered in an urn beneath a house, just outside Rome. However, neither account seems well-evidenced. Meaney, however, was convinced that despite the fact that the crystal ball’s esoteric significance could be traced back in the direction of Scythian heritage (and thereby, toward the Pontic-Caspian steppe), the Germanics must have encountered it first among the Romans. She writes: \"even if the crystal balls originated in the Black Sea area or further east, probably they ... were transmitted to the Germans mainly through the Romans ...\" \n\n \n\nAnd yet, we know that by the time Pliny describes the virtue of the crystal, they are already being buried in Sarmatian graves. By the time the Lithica appears, the Germanic tradition covers Northern Europe and reaches Scandinavia. Even if we were to take up the position that the Romans were the source of the Germanic tradition(s), surely there would be more archaeological evidence than, apparently, none at all. And so, as-to the issue of origin, here we must content ourselves instead to gaze wistfully in the direction of Scythia. \n\n \n\nMore likely than a Roman source for the Germanic amulets per se, it may be, that the Indo-European lapidary lore of the earlier Romans either did not preserve, or did not foment the amuletic crystal balls that we find with such commonality among the Germanics. The Germanics, on the other hand, would perhaps either have developed the amulets and disseminated them among their progeny in Northern Europe, or, inherited them more directly from a Scythian source. So it seems, and so we return to the issue of the Germanic crystal ball and its usage.\n\n \n\nWhat little scholarly discourse has been afforded to puzzling over the purpose of these amulets through the years, has been complicated somewhat on account of the fact that a large portion of crystal balls found in Anglo-Saxon graves are curiously, and deliberately, associated with another item. As it happens, many crystal pendants are not unearthed alone, but rather, are found resting within the bowl of an ornate spoon—that is, having been placed in the spoon to form a pairing. These spoons are often richly decorated, and made of silver or leafed in gold. Further, they typically exhibit perforations in the bottom of the bowl (sometimes arranged in an emblematic shape). These perforations have led scholars to refer to them as ‘sieve spoons.’ Therefore, any proper understanding of the significance of the crystal ball among the Anglo-Saxons and their Germanic cousins must account for its relation to the sieve spoon.\n\n \n\nAs is so-often the case with modern scholarship there is ample work to the effect of cataloging instances of these artifacts in the material record. However when it comes to understanding the purpose of the object, thoughts are relatively scant—and what of it there is, is hardly satisfactory. Meaney, for her part, only advances few suggestions as-if in formality, in the final paragraphs of her otherwise exhaustive survey. She suggests that they bear some similarity to wine-straining or mead straining utensils, as others had also noted. Therefore, perhaps only women wealthy enough to afford to import wine, or, to be buried in graves so richly as the ones in which these items are found, fancied such ornamental straining utensils. It follows that they took some pleasure in displaying their sieve spoons on their belts as a show of station. Perhaps sensing the credulity required of such a disappointing explanation, a passing reference to the Beowulf is supplied, in support of the idea that even in wealthy contexts it was taken as the duty of the woman of the house to serve the drink. \n\n \n\nWith this explanation no mind is paid to the fact that the so-called ‘sieve’ spoons often exhibit perforations too small or scarce to adequately strain a serving of wine or mead at all. One finds it difficult to imagine pouring a glass of wine through some of these spoons, in increments. While it’s true that the spoons do bear some resemblance to strainers, we would suggest instead that the resemblance is down to the fact that the function served was similar, but was not at all the same. Most damning however is that such an explanation disregards the presence of the crystal ball entirely; an item which was quite plainly of high value, and, as we have seen, was the specific subject of at least eight centuries' worth of metaphysical reverence—likely more.\n\n \n\nIn truth there has been a fair amount of argument between a relative handful of scholars on these subjects. Some hold that there is no evidence for the use of crystals in any magical context prior to the advent of Christianity—a position which is patently mistaken. Others have noted, and quite rightly so, that the obvious explanation for the crystal-spoon pairing in Germanic graves points toward the well-documented practice of preparing healing concoctions by ‘steeping’ a precious stone in certain medicinal tinctures. The process, sometimes called silvering, involves dipping the crystal into a cup—or an entire well—thereby conferring some benefit. The tincture is then consumed. In other versions, ‘scrapings’ of crystal or gemstone are prepared in the tincture to be drank. It’s much more likely that the sieve spoon was used to wash or pour-over the crystal in the medicinal tincture, and on account of that, these items are so tightly associated in the graves. In light of all this, we ought to plainly dispense with Meaney’s contention that the spoon and crystal ball were only loosely independent symbols; that the one served to advertise a woman’s role as the pourer-of-wine, and that the other was a fire-symbol that laxly associated the woman with tending the household. \n\n \n\nWhat is clear is that both the spoon and the crystal ball are assimilated to some healing function according to a qualitative, watery mechanism. It’s along this line of rationale that we can begin to fold in a discussion of the gemstone’s role in divination. When, then, did the crystal ball first become an object for speculation (specularii); for scrying; how old is the notion of crystal-gazing? Quite simply: It's difficult to argue for a date much earlier than the Renaissance. Forays further into history uncover traditions that are noticeably less concerned with peering into a crystal ball or gemstone, and instead, which are more concerned with other surfaces or objects that exhibit an esoteric relationship to light. It appears that later, only, did the mystical importance of precious stones acquire this particular 'modern' function. Prior to the Renaissance the gemstone, in the medieval canon that is, appears instead to function primarily as a healing object more-so than a focus for speculation. By contrast the most common historical implement for divination by gazing—or speculation—is surely a bowl of water; a scrying dish. But also frequently employed are mirrors, fingernails, ink poured in the hands, and even in some instances, the polished blade of a sword. Upon reflection it’s not altogether difficult to understand how the higher crystal-lore in medicine might have unraveled into the lower art of crystallomancy in divination.\n\n \n\nElsewhere I have attempted to describe a certain tendency toward involution, saying that once there was a theurgic dance, now there is only idiotic motion. Eliade and Hall have both discussed the same idea after their own fashion, far better than I, as did Cioran, as has any with eyes to see and the gall to look. The ritual often persists long after the purpose of the ritual has dissolved into the mist history. The theurgic dance here, if you will, can be thought of as the notion of the gemstone as it was to the natural philosophers. Over many centuries these ideas are preserved, even if they are not well understood: The gemstone, though earthy, is at once alike to water; that it enjoys some special relationship to the sun, evidenced in its brilliance, in its in-dwelling or esoteric fire; not unlike the body itself; clay, animated by spiritual fire and living water, and that the gemstone is an agent of the Indo-European solar healing traditions. But because of these magico-religious healing properties, it seems that the gemstone came to be regarded as an object of 'divine knowledge.’ On account of that decadent generalization, it is suddenly positioned to fall prey (during the Renaissance, as the case here may be) to a more vulgar mentality. As an object of divine gnosis, it might be scrutinized in the form of a proto-materialistic art, and be made to render special knowledge to some mundane practitioner. And so we arrive at the image of a crystal ball so well known today: A thing from which charlatans purport to wring data for the benefit of credulous customers. Protestant hammers and chisels, then, lay only just around the corner. So the mill turns. \n\n​\n\n​\n\n+\n\n​\n\nWolfram's Grail-stone\n\n \n\nAt this point, it's prudent to focus our attention on a certain detail only hinted at thus far: the perception of a metaphysical link between the body and the gemstone. It’s from this vantage—having isolated what is essential to the symbolism of the heavenly stone—that Tolkien’s Palantíri will reemerge in rather fascinating consistency with the mystical character of foundation stones. Nowhere is this set of occult, poetic ideas more eloquently assembled than in Wolfram von Eschenbach's 12th century epic Parzival.\n\n \n\nParzival has often confused scholars. In the Grail legends—that is, in the series of medieval texts that crop up from France, to England, to Germany (all within about 25 years of one another) which are concerned with the Holy Grail, Parzival is utterly unique. In all other Grail traditions, the object itself is of course some sort of dish, cup, serving platter, goblet, or what have you. Linked to the Christian Passion, the Grail is either the very cup from which Christ offered his blood at the last supper, or, was used to collect blood and water from his wound upon the cross. According to many, these cups are one and the same. In Parzival however, the Grail is a stone. \n\n \n\nG. Ronald Murphy has done fantastic scholarship on the subject where before there was little; toward the end of positioning Wolfram’s Grail-stone not as a thing we must chalk up to the eccentricity of its author, but rather, as a symbol that bears a great deal of resonance with the Christian tradition. “Wolfram’s stone Grail,” Murphy observes with disappointment, “is often allowed by scholars of Grail legend to disappear quietly into the waste forest of mystifying and unintelligible metaphor.” Understanding the Grail-stone as an extension of earlier Indo-European lapidary lore, albeit in a Christianized form, then, we can turn to Evola’s treatise on the Grail Mystery and its Hyperborean roots. But first, what of Wolfram and his stone?\n\n \n\nIn surveying the litany of qualities and abilities that Wolfram apportions to his Grail-stone, Murphy first recognizes three essential functions. For one, many qualities of the Grail-stone align it with the blessed sacrament of the altar. For two, the Grail-stone is quite clearly assimilated to the holy sepulcher in Jerusalem. And finally, the Grail-stone is evidently a metaphor for the body of Christ himself. “The only rock I can think of that can fulfill all these requirements,” he concludes, “including that of being the Holy Sepulcher in a sense both metaphorical and yet real, is the altar stone.”\n\n \n\nThe altar stone in this context refers to the increasing pressure for Christians to be able to consecrate a table for Mass during the Crusading eras. It was something of a problem for pilgrims and crusaders to find a sensible way to perform the associated rituals abroad—often times on board a ship or in foreign lands far from a church, for example. Where before mass took place at a fixed location; where the consecration was established architecturally, and, according to the permanent disposition and enshrinement of reliquaries, by Wolfram’s era ‘portable altars’ had become quite popular across Europe. Hardly a museum on the continent is absent a lavishly decorated example of just such an altar. \n\n \n\nIn short, the portable altar was a microcosmic object that, when placed on the table, sufficiently consecrated that place for Mass; for the dispensation of the Eucharist. Most altars of this type take the form of a rectangular box, of a size able to be carried by hand, which contained a cutting quite literally called the ‘sepulcher,’ in which a symbolic offering that bore some alikeness to the body of Christ, was deposited. The cutting was then closed by an in-set stone, often a precious stone, as the tomb of Christ was closed. “Many medieval bishops were buried with such portable altars with them,” Murphy explains, “for the journey, and with a very small chalice and paten in their hands. These small chalices and patens were designed to be used directly on the altar stone atop the reliquary box when there was no table at all present.” \n\n \n\nAlready the reader can begin to understand the full metaphorical scope of such an object: The foundation sacrifice of pre-Christian times, which I have discussed at length elsewhere, has been fully inculturated in one sense. It has taken on the form of Christ’s sacrifice. His body lay literally among the foundations of the Church, and therefore, if you will, the rock and the body both are positioned in the role of the foundation stone of the new City of Ezekiel. In this way all of the Indo-European religious ideas that associate the body of the divine with the birth of the mundane realm, with the origin, structure, and architecture of the cosmos, are re-expressed in the Christian tongue. “Petra autem erat Christus,” writes Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae. The stone is Christ. Here, as well, we can start to properly lay our hands around the importance of the fact that Tolkien’s Palantíri are not merely precious stones; they are not merely scrying tools, but also, are models of the earth—unable to function without their two poles properly aligned to the poles of the earth—and further, each of Elendil’s stones are inseparably linked to the foundation of the major cities, and fortifications of the Kingdoms of Men. \n\n \n\nAs a curious aside, there is a peculiar idea which has persisted on the periphery of the Grail-stone idea, that the Grail was in fact a gem which adorned the crown of Lucifer. The stone was said to have fallen from his crown when he was cast down to earth. This idea was briefly repeated in a playbill for Richard Wagner’s Parsifal, attributed to Wolfram, which scandalized Wagner—as he was aware of its actual provenance. In truth, this story first appears in a 13th century poem titled Wartburtkrieg, in which Wolfram von Eschenbach appears as a fictional character. The unknown author of the Wartburtkrieg thus puts the tale of a gem fallen from Lucifer’s crown into Wolfram’s mouth. It’s that version which the author of Wagner’s playbill mistakenly attributed to Wolfram, and on this account Wagner had the bill quickly amended. What historical interest the episode may have aside, one cannot help but see that Tolkien was aware of this parallel tradition, when he recounted that Beren and Lúthien pried the radiant Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. \n\n \n\nThe usage of precious stones in healing arts is an idea that withstood the passage of time, and even the onset of the Christian millennium in Europe. In fact, the Church on several occasions weighed in on the question of whether or not such use of precious stones constituted heresy—against the idea. It’s well established that the miraculous character of the gemstone was self-evident enough, and strong enough to the Medieval mind that it merited ecclesiastical sanction. On one such occasion, at the Council of Sens in France, 1140 A.D., Peter Abelard was rebuked by edict for suggesting, erroneously, that it was the Devil who put the idea in mens’ minds that various herbs and stones have uses in healing procedures. \n\n \n\nWe know Thomas Aquinas held to the mystical importance of this train of thought, connecting as he did the stone to the body of Christ. Scholars, priests, theologians, and educated types of all position were in general accord with the magical picture of the gemstone. But moreover, and as we see in Wolfram, the Grail-stone was more than a magical object per-se, it “evoked Eden;” it was of Eden, and therefore, exemplified a purer Heavenly character. For this reason does it facilitate the passage of light—a miracle after a fashion—and one which was important not just in the literary realm, but also in the realm of architectural consecration; we come back around to the superposition of gemstone, Grail, and foundation sacrifice. Writing to clarify the theological linkage between light and stone in the age of Wolfram, Murphy explains: \n\n \n\n“It was [Abbot Suger] who did more than any other person to give us the miraculously translucent walls of the stone building we call the Gothic Cathedral. It was he who delighted in showing, like Wolfram, that light is sufficiently related to divinity that it can pass through stone. … When he dedicated [Saint Denis Cathedral] in Paris, he even had the king and all the notaries present each place their own stones in the foundation walls propriis manibus, with their own hands, thus identifying themselves with the light-transmitting walls of the building.”\n\n \n\nThe Abbot Suger, in his own work De Consecratione, describes the process of raising the cathedral walls. Some of those who placed stones even brought gemstones and laid them among the foundations, singing as they did: Lapides Preciosi Omnes Muri Tui. All your walls are precious stones. Murphy again notes that in doing so they deliberately identified “themselves in the language of the new church style as being the stones of a heavenly and translucent Jerusalem in the north.”\n\n \n\nMany bishops and Abbesses wrote on the specific virtues of each variety of precious stone, committing them to a Christian canon of mysticism which carried intellectual weight in those days. In the writings of St. Augustine of Hippo we find a clear exposition of the train of thought that positions the Grail-stone not just as the heritage of Paradise, but more specifically, in the waters of Paradise. His commentary on the book of Genesis includes a curious passage on the subject. St. Augustine explains that God fashioned mankind de limo terrae; of the [clay of the] earth, and takes care to point out that by clay, water is deliberately intoned—not simply dust; linking the Christian idea with the great maze of mythopoeic thought that went before; unknowing, perhaps, but nevertheless in-conistency with the Indo-European traditions that persisted in the European mind for millennia. In our survey of the symbolism of the index finger, we explored the deep connections between water, blood, hepatocentrism, and the Hyperborean healing tradition. For now, the point is only to apprehend that in this Medieval discussion of the gemstone we hear again echoes of some familiar ideas: Wetness defines life, dryness defines death. It's a thought process which is evidenced throughout the Indo-European languages, and signals to us that we are dealing with a deeply ancient principle. This notion we have termed “Two-Bloodedness,” in the foregoing studies: the blood-flowing; fiery, vital, and red on the one hand, on the other the blood spilt, dried, bruised, and cold. The former renders us the words for ichor, liver, and life, and the latter rendering us the words for cold, corpse, etc. And so St. Augustine calls his readers’ attention to the fact that mankind was of an elemental commixture, which defines liveliness: limus enim aquae ac terrae comixtio est. “Just as water collects and coagulates the earth together in a mixture of water and earth, thus creating clay,” he explains, “in the same way the living-spirit [anima] of the body gives life to the material of the body, thus holding it together in harmonious unity and not permitting the body to fall into dissolution.” \n\n \n\nFollowing this discussion Augustine goes on to describe the river of Paradise, which irrigates the garden and thereafter is divided into the four major rivers that flow over the face of the earth, according to the Medieval picture. This heavenly gemstone; its formation in the high places of the world, as ice, and flowing down into the world takes on now a similar character. Originating in the celestial realm, the river of Paradise communicates the sacred stones—which, like the human body, and like the body of Christ are at once of earth and water; which are ‘invigorated’ in this way, and so are of course attributed healing powers, restorative powers, etc—down into the mortal realm. We can understand in this way too, quite simply, how the watery nature of the stone is superimposed with this picture of an in-dwelling or esoteric fire—enlivened or ensouled after the same qualitative mechanism as-is man himself, the stone exhibits an analogous fiery anima. \n\n \n\nTolkien’s description of the Palantíri perhaps returns to the reader’s mind, here again, for he described the stone as having just such an in-dwelling fire. Not to be remiss, either, we pause to take note that the Medieval picture of the eye; of the function of light and sight; involved rays of light being emitted directly from the viewing source, and acting upon the object to be viewed. The eye was not, as we understand it today, believed to be a passive receptor of light. Rather, the eye and the sun were much the same, the eye of man and the solar eye of God, emitted light out into the world watchfully. It’s hardly necessary to gesture toward the surveilling eye aflame atop the tower, away in Tolkien's utter East. Rather, we observe that the Palantíri’s inner fire and far-seeing function, together with the eye-ignited all share in this confluence of ideas. It's most consistent with historical thought, that Tolkien's seeing-stones involve an in-dwelling light and therefore a special correspondence with sight. \n\n \n\n\"The Carbuncle and the Leek-green stone,\" St. Augustine writes of the river of Paradise \"are there.\" Glossing over the fact that these two stones and their respective colors are central to Wolfram’s depiction of the Grail-stone and of its procession, we can move forward briefly to the lapidary writing of St. Hildegard of Bingen. Her lifetime may well have overlapped Wolfram’s own, at the end. Hildegard develops the ideas of St. Aquinas, repeated by Albertus Magnus, with roots in Rome and further, as we have suggested to Greece wherefrom they were carried, and so on. The following passage from Murphy’s study on the subject will suffice to summarize, and release us back to the more obscure issue of the Palantíri’s role as foundation stones. He explains:\n\n \n\n“Wolfram uses all four threads of the Christian tradition on gems: he uses Augustine’s gem-laden rivers of Eden for the Grail and Gahmuret; Hildegard’s for the medicinal maintenance of keeping Anfortas alive; Bishop Marble’s for the analogy of person and gem, for Parzival and Conwiramurs. He uses the more scientific tradition found in Albertus Magnus, in Arnoldus Saxo, and even in the later Thomas Aquinas to establish the nature of all gems as water, water that will culminate in the ruby and jasper gems of the flowing baptismal font, and in the tears of repentance, compassion, and happiness.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\n+\n\n \n\nElendil, and the Stones in Exile\n\n \n\nThere has been much discussion over the term Lapis Exilis, by which Wolfram names the Grail-stone. In comparing the tradition to Tolkien, we first wonder—does not the name imply that the Grail-stone was the ‘stone in exile;’ surely here again we find an alignment between Tolkien’s thought and the mythopoeic material of history. The Luciferian Stone, as Evola calls Wolfram’s Grail-stone (and all of the associated scholarship which we have thus-far enumerated, that lies beneath the surface of this symbol), is much the same. Hildegard tells us that Lucifer was covered in gems by God, and seeing his reflection in the mirror, believed himself first God’s equal, and quickly thereafter, his superior—hence the fall, and hence perhaps the notion in the Wartburtkrieg that the Grail-stone fell from Lucifer’s crown. In Evolian terms, the Luciferian stone is only a ‘heavenly stone,’ and in his seminal work on the pre-Christian origins of the themes that characterize the Grail cycle, he first touches on that most confusing name: Lapis Exilis. If it is indeed only meant to characterize the Grail-stone as being of-exile, in the Luciferian sense—light-bringer, that is, the heavenly stone which descended; the precious stone of Paradise, aflame and flowing down from some celestial source—we can obviously connect the Palantíri to the same mythemes. Carried from the land of Valinor, the home of celestials, borne by Elendil in exile from the fall of Númenor into the realm of Middle-earth. \n\n \n\nAnd yet scholars have interpreted the origin or meaning encoded in the term in various ways. Lapis Erilis, or the Lord’s stone; Lapis Elixir, or the alchemical magnum opus; Lapis Betillis, which according to Hagen might be a reference to the sky-fallen stone of Greek lore; or more simply Lapis Ex Coleus, the stone out of the sky. “In reality,” Evola observes with clarity and conviction rare among the institutional scholars of today, “the Grail is susceptible to all of these meanings.” To this grouping of superimposed meanings, and growing out of the belief that through Tolkien we can engage with authentic historical scholarship, we will advance one further, which to our knowledge has yet to be proposed.\n\n \n\nFollowing the philological root of the word exilis, we find the same issues that confused early scholars. Exilis is typically translated as ‘thinness,’ or ‘slenderness,’ and so Wolfram’s stone was initially called (somewhat bafflingly) a slender stone. The Latin in fact is a conjunction of two words, the first of which Ex- is self explanatory, but the second of which is most interesting: Iles. If a Greek heritage is accepted, the word descends from something like εἰλεός (Eileos), meaning ‘to shut-in’ or to bind-up, binding perhaps directing us to a critical Proto-Indo-European spiritual idea, but nevermind. In the Pontic-Caspian lineage that root is rendered *welH, or ‘to roll, turn, wind.’ The obvious heavenly connotation is clear—a heavenly stone is of course a stone that could be metaphorically called ‘winding,’ or Exilis, of the turning sky; of the wheel or the mill of the empyrean. Perhaps we are content to stop here. A similar reading would have us halt as well, the stone that rolled ‘out of heaven.’ Fair enough. \n\n \n\nAnd yet, there is a related root in the Proto-Indo-European; *wel-, meaning ‘to see, or perceive.’ And suddenly it’s as if a great door is thrown open. Hundreds of words in all of the Indo-European tongues descend from here; Seeing-Stone, or the stone which watches: Lapis Ex-Iles. \n\n \n\nOf course we do not mean to suggest that Tolkien deliberately wove this unbelievably complicated thread all the way through his literary accomplishments, but rather, we mean to make the point with conviction that Tolkien’s work belongs in the company of the great poets of history, because these threads are authentically preserved in Middle-earth, because they are able to be found there just as readily as they are to be found in the archaeologists’ trenches. It is to say that Tolkien’s achievement stands above and apart from modern literature, according to this peerless quality. In setting out to craft a mythology for England, as he once offered, with humility, it’s according to this spectacular metric that his readers the world over—knowing or unknowing—unanimously agree that he succeeded.\n\n \n\nNow Tolkien’s Palantíri, black as glass, Seeing-Stones, yes, but foundation stones also, bear some curious likeness to the black stone that lay at the heart of the founding of Rome: the Lapis Niger. Dumezil’s book on the subject of the mystical dimension of the Lapis Niger has regrettably never appeared translated into English. Nevertheless it’s through comparison to the Lapis Niger, which scholars agree played some regal role early on in Rome’s history, to analogous coronation stones; to the Scottish Stone of Kings, that we see the Palantíri serving Elendil’s line. The same stone appears having been carried down from heaven in the Tuatha de Danaan—far from being symbol born among the Christians, but again, having been inculturated by Medieval Christian tradition. In Gandalf’s words the “Stones of Kings,” as we know them in history, are folded into the symbolism of the Palantír. A passage from Evola’s study of the Grail lore will be of use:\n\n \n\n“In these legends, no matter how free of religious overtones, we find again the connection of the Grail, conceived as a heavenly stone, with a mysterious legacy and power associated with a primordial state that was somehow preserved during a period of exile. … The theme of a host of angels descending from heaven with the Grail resembles the theme of the race of the Tuatha de Danaan, which was believed to be composed of divine beings. This race came to Ireland carrying a supernatural stone (the stone of legitimate kings) … The homeland of the Tuatha was Avalon which, according to tradition, is also the seat of the books of the Grail, and which has often been confused … with the place in which the Grail was eminently revealed. … They are described as inhabitants of a Western-Atlantic region, which was visited by Saint Brendan. This region is a facsimile of Avalon … the “Island,” the original homeland and inviolable center of the Tuatha.”\n\n \n\nThe Avalon of the Grail cycle is easily identified with Valinor, and its inhabitants with the Noldor who first awoke and journeyed to that land—who wrought the Silmarils and the Palantiri. To press the point  however we might observe here, at the close, that Tolkien contrived the word “Avallónë” in the Quenya tongue to name the tower in Valinor where the greatest of all the Palantiri abides: the Master Stone, or \"The Stone of Avallónë.\" Elendil set up the first of his rocks in Armor at Elostirion, and from there, Tolkien tells us that he was able to peer across the sea even so far as Avallónë, which comforted him when he longed for the west."
